# Movement Types

Creatures in Pathfinder soar through the clouds, scale sheer cliffs, and tunnel underfoot. The majority of creatures have a Speed, which is how fast they can move across the ground.  
  
Some abilities give you different ways to move, such as through the air or underground. Each of these special movement types has its own Speed value. Many creatures have these Speeds naturally, such as a bird having a fly Speed or a fish having a swim Speed.

## Mechanical Rules

- Speeds can be increased or decreased with item, circumstance, and status bonuses and penalties. Penalties can't reduce your Speeds below 5 feet unless stated otherwise.  
- Since Speed by itself refers to your normal land Speed, rules text concerning special movement types specifies the movement types to which it applies.
- Since the Stride action can be used only with your normal land Speed, moving using special movement types requires using a special action.
	- You can't Step while using one of these special movement types.
	- Switching from one movement type to another requires ending your action that has the first movement type and using a new action that has the second movement type.



## Speed

Most characters and monsters have a Speed statistic that indicates how quickly they can move across the ground. This statistic is referred to as land Speed when it's necessary to differentiate it from special Speeds.  
  
When you use the Stride action, you move a number of feet equal to your Speed. Numerous other abilities also allow you to move, from [[Crawl|Crawling]] to [[Leap|Leaping]], and most of them are based on your Speed in some way. Whenever a rule mentions your Speed without specifying a type, it's referring to your land Speed.  

The other various types of movement are listed below. 

[[Burrow Speed]]
[[Climb Speed]]
[[Fly Speed]]
[[Swim Speed]]
