# Hostile

**Description:** Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.

## Mechanical Rules

- This condition reflects a creature's disposition toward a particular character, and only supernatural effects (like a spell) can impose on a PC.
- A creature hostile to a character actively seeks to harm that character. It doesn't necessarily attack, but it won't accept a [[Request]] from the character.

## Gameplay Action

- Sometimes spells prevent a target from using hostile actions, or the spell ends if a creature uses any hostile actions.
	- A hostile action is one that can harm or damage another creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not one that a creature is unaware could cause harm.
	  For instance, casting fireball into a crowd would be a hostile action, but opening a door and accidentally freeing a horrible monster wouldn’t be.
	  The GM is the final arbitrator of what is a hostile action.
