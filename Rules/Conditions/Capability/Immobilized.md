# Immobilized

**Description:** You are incapable of movement.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can't use any actions that have the `Move` trait.
- If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.

## Inheritance Sources

- [[Grabbed]]
- [[Restrained]]

## Gameplay Interaction

- To end the condition, you may be able to attempt to [[Escape]] or [[Force Open]] your bonds.
