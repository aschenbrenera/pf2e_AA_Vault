# Restrained

**Description:** You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned.

## Mechanical Rules

- Restrained overrides [[Grabbed]]  
- You can't use any actions with the `Attack` or `Manipulate` trait except to attempt to [[Escape]] or [[Force Open]] your bonds.  
- Inherit [[Off-Guard]].
	- You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC.  
- Inherit [[Immobilized]].
	- You can't use any actions that have the move trait.
	- If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against either the DC of the effect holding you in place or the relevant defense (usually Fortitude DC) of the monster holding you in place.

## Gameplay Interaction

- To end the condition, you may be able to attempt to [[Escape]] or use [[Force Open]].
	- Escape focuses on beating the effectiveness of what applied the condition.
	- Force Open focuses on destroying the physical material used to apply the condition.
- Allows the creature applying this condition to you to attempt to [[Reposition]] you.

## Gameplay Tips

- While Force Open is an alternate option, it will rarely be the optimal choice. Both actions support athletics, and It only makes sense if the Effect DC would be higher than the material being used to apply the effect. For example, if a character with a high Thievery skill tied you up with basic rope, their Thievery DC could be higher than the DC to break the rope.
