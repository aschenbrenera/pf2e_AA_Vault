# Wounded

**Description:** You have been seriously injured. Wounded always includes a value.

## Mechanical Rules

-  If you gain the [[Dying]] condition while wounded, increase your dying condition value by your wounded value.  

## Gameplay Interaction

- Anytime you lose the Dying condition, you become wounded 1 if you didnâ€™t already have the wounded condition. If you already have the wounded condition, your wounded condition value instead increases by 1.  
- The wounded condition ends if someone successfully restores Hit Points to you with [[Treat Wounds]], or if you are restored to full Hit Points and rest for 10 minutes.
