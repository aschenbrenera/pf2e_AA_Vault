# Using Shields

**Description:** A shield can increase your character's defense beyond the protection their armor provides. 

## Mechanical Rules
- Your character must be wielding a shield in one hand to make use of it, and it grants its bonus to AC only if they use an action to [[Raise a Shield]]. 
	- This action grants the shield's bonus to AC as a circumstance bonus until their next turn starts. 
	- All shields, unless specifically noted or described otherwise, must be strapped to your arm and held in one hand, so you can't hold anything with that hand and Raise a Shield, and you lose the shield's benefits if that hand is no longer free. 
- A shield's Speed penalty applies whenever your character is holding the shield, whether they have raised it or not.  
- If you have access to the [[Shield Block]] reaction, you can use if your shield is raised to reduce the damage of a physical attack by the an amount equal to the shield's Hardness. The remaining damage after reduction is dealt to both you and the shield. 
	- If the shield reaches it's [[Broken]] Threshold it becomes unusable until it's repaired.
