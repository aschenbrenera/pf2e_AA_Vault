# Rune Etching

## Mechanical Rules

- Etching a rune onto an item follows the same process as using the [[Craft]] activity to make an item. 
	- You must be able to Craft magic items, have the formula for the rune, have the item you’re adding the rune to in your possession throughout the etching process, and meet any special Craft Requirements.
	- The rune has no effect until you complete the Craft activity. You can etch only one rune at a time.
- You can transfer runes between two items. This uses the [[Craft]] activity.
	- You must be able to craft magical items.
	- You can either move one rune from one item to another or swap a rune on one item with a rune on the other item (which can be a [[Runestone]]).
		- To swap, the runes must both be fundamental runes or both be property runes.
	- The DC of the Crafting check to transfer a rune is determined by the item level of the rune being transferred.
		- To swap, use the higher level between the two runes.
	- The Price of the transfer is 10% of the rune's price, unless transferring from a runestone, which is free. 
		- To swap, use the higher price between the two runes.
	- It takes 1 day (instead of the 4 days usually needed to Craft) to transfer a rune or swap a pair of runes, and you can continue to work over additional days to get a discount, as usual with Craft.
