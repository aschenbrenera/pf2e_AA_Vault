# Leather Group

The thick second skin of the armor disperses blunt force to reduce bludgeoning damage.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- You gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for medium armor, or 2 + the value of the armor’s potency rune for heavy armor.
