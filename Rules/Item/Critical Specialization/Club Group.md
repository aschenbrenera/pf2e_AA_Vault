# Club Group

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). 
	- This is [[Forced Movement]].
- You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
