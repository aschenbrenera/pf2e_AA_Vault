# Knife Group

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage|Persistent]] [[Damage Types#Bleed Damage|Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
- You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
