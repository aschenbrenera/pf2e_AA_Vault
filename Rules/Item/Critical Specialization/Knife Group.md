# Knife Group

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage|Persistent]] [[Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
	- Bleed Damage is persistent damageÂ that represents loss of blood.
		- As such, it has no effect on nonliving creatures or living creatures that don't need blood to live.
		- Weaknesses and resistances to physical damage apply.
		- Bleed damage ends automatically if you're healed to your full Hit Points.
- You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
