# Brawling Group

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Slowed]] 1 until the end of your next turn.
