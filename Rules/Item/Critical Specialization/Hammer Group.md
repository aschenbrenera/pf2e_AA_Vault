# Hammer Group

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- The target is knocked [[Prone]] unless they succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC.
