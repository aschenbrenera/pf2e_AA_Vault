# Axe Group

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its _striking_ rune, if any).
	- This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
