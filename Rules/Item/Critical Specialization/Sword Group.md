# SwordGroup

Certain feats, class features, weapon runes, and other effects can grant you additional benefits when you make a Strike with certain weapons and get a critical success. This is called a critical specialization effect.

## Mechanical Rules
  
- The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
- You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.
