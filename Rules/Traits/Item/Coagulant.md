# Coagulant

Healing alchemical items with the coagulant trait lose effectiveness when many are applied in a short period of time. 

## Mechanical Rules

- If a creature heals Hit Points from an item with the coagulant trait, that creature is temporarily immune to healing Hit Points from subsequent items with the coagulant trait for 10 minutes (but not immune to any other effects of those items).
