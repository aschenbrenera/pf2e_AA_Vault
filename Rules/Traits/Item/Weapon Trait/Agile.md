# Agile

## Mechanical Rules

- The [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.

### Multiple Attack Penalty

| **Attack**           | **Standard** | **Agile** |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| First                | None                        | None      |
| Second               | -5                          | -4        |
| Third and subsequent | -10                         | -8        |
