# Free-Hand

This weapon doesn’t take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor.

## Mechanical Rules

- A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed.
- You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on.
- You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand.
- When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand.
- Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.
