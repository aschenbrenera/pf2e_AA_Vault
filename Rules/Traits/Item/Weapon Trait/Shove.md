# Shove

You can use this weapon to Shove.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand.
	- This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check.
	- If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
