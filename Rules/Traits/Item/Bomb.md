# Bomb

An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical components that explode when the bomb hits a creature or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though some produce other effects.

All bombs are special weapons use the default statistics found in the weapon's table under [[Alchemical Bomb]].

## Mechanical Rules

- Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range increment of 20 feet.
- When you throw a bomb, you make a weapon attack roll against the target's AC, as you would for any other weapon.
	- It takes one hand to draw, prepare, and throw a bomb.
	- The bomb is activated when thrown as a Strike; you don't have to activate it separately.
- As consumables, bombs can't have runes etched onto them, have talismans attached to them, or benefit from runes granted in other ways (such as from spells or from items that replicate runes from other items).
	- Spells and magic items that give you a bonus to all your attacks (or to all thrown weapons, for example) can still apply to them.
