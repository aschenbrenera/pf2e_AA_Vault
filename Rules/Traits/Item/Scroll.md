# Scroll

A scroll contains a single spell you can cast without a spell slot.


### Additional Info

A scroll contains a single spell that you can cast without having to expend a spell slot. A scroll can be crafted to contain nearly any spell. The exceptions are cantrips, focus spells]), and rituals, none of which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular spell rank, as determined by the scroll. If no rank is listed, the scroll can be used to cast the spell at its lowest rank.  
  
If you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell it contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell list or a spell you know, you can spend a single Recall Knowledge action and automatically succeed at identifying the scroll's spell. If it's not, you must Identify Magic.

Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions for that spell. The spell must appear on your spell list. Because you're the one Casting the Spell, use your spell attack modifier and spell DC. The spell also gains the appropriate trait for your tradition.  
  
Any physical costs are provided when a scroll is created, so you don't need to provide them when casting from a scroll. If the spell requires a locus, you must have that locus to Cast the Spell from a scroll.

### Crafting a Scroll

The process to [[Craft]] a scroll is much like that to Craft any other magic item. When you begin the crafting process, choose a spell to put into the scroll. You must either cast the spell during the crafting process, or someone else must do so in your presence. Casting that Spell doesn't produce its normal effects; instead, the magic is trapped inside the scroll. The casting must come from a spellcaster expending a spell slot. You can't Craft a scroll from a spell produced from another magic item, for example. The caster must provide any cost of the spell. A scroll's rarity is the same as that of the spell it contains.  
  
Like other consumables, scrolls can be crafted in batches of four. All scrolls of one batch must contain the same spell at the same rank, and you must provide one casting for each scroll that is crafted.
