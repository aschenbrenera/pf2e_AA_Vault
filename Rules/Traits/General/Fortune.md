# Fortune

A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. 

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.

# Misfortune
A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it.

If a fortune effect and a misfortune effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
