# Splash

Some weapons and effects, such as alchemical bombs, have the splash trait. 

- When you use a weapon or effect with the splash trait, you don’t add your Strength modifier to the damage roll.
- Add splash damage together with the initial damage against the target before applying the target’s resistance or weakness.
- You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.
- Weapons or effects with splash use the following degrees of success.

>[!success-degree] 
>- **Critical Success:** All creatures within 5 feet of the target take splash damage.
>- **Success:** All creatures within 5 feet of the target take splash damage.
>- **Failure:** Target takes splash damage.
>- **Critical Failure:** Miss entirely, dealing no damage.
