# Morph

Effects that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait.  
  
## Mechanical Rules

- Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical.
- You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to [[Counteracting|Counteract]] the first. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.
	- Your Morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect.
