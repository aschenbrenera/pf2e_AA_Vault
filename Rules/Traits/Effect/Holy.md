# Holy

Effects with the holy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of benevolence and virtue. They often have stronger effects on unholy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to holy causes and often have weakness toÂ unholy. If a creature with weakness to holy uses a holy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness.
