# Illusion

Effects and magic items with this trait involve false sensory stimuli.
Illusions create the semblance of something real, fooling the eyes, ears, and other senses. Depending on how the illusion is perceived, it might have the `Auditory` or `Visual` traits, and some also have the `Mental` trait.

## Disbelieving Illusions

Sometimes illusions allow an affected creature a chance to disbelieve the spell, which lets the creature effectively ignore the spell if it succeeds at doing so. 

## Mechanical Rules

- If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. 
- To attempt to disbelieve an illusion, a creature must intentionally engage with it, typically using: **Seek**, **Interact**, or another meaningful action chosen by the GM.
	- The action triggers a check—usually Perception vs. the caster’s Spell DC. For some mental illusions, the spell might specify a Will save instead.
	- On success, ignore all of the illusion's effects. Even after disbelieving, illusions may still impose concealment effects, at the GM’s discretion.
