# Unholy

Effects with the unholy trait are tied to powerful magical forces of cruelty and sin. They often have stronger effects on holy creatures. Creatures with this trait are strongly devoted to unholy causes, and often have weakness toÂ holy. If a creature with weakness to unholy uses an unholy item or effect, it takes damage from its weakness.
