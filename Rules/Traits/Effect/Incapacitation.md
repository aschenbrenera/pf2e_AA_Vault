# Incapacitation

An ability with this trait can take a character completely out of the fight or even kill them, and itâ€™s harder to use on a more powerful character. 

## Mechanical Rules

- If the incapacitation trait is on a spell, a creature with a level of more than twice the spell's  effective rank gains the listed benefit against the spell (Heightened Spells increase a spell's effective rank).
- If the incapacitation trait is on any effect other than a spell, a creature of higher level than the source of the effect gains the listed benefit against the effect.
- **Benefit:** Creatures with this benefit treat the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated as one degree of success better or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse.
