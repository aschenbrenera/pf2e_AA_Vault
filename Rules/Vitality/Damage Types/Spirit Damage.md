# Spirit Damage

Directly affecting the spiritual essence of a creature, [[Spirit]] damage can damage a target projecting its consciousness or possessing another creature even if the target's body is elsewhere. The possessed creature isn't harmed by the blast. Spirit damage doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs. Many effects that deal spirit damage also have the [[Sanctified]], [[Holy]], or [[Unholy]] trait.
