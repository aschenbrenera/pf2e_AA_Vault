# Physical Damage

Damage dealt by weapons, many physical hazards, and a handful of spells is collectively called physical damage. 

The main types of physical damage are bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. 
- **Bludgeoning** damage comes from weapons and hazards that deal blunt-force trauma, like a hit from a club or being dashed against rocks. 
- **Piercing** damage is dealt from stabs and punctures, whether from a dragon's fangs or the thrust of a spear. 
- **Slashing** damage is delivered by a cut, be it the swing of the sword or the blow from a scythe blades trap.  

[[Bleed Damage]] is also a special type of physical damage that represents loss of blood.
