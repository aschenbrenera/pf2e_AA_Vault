# Damage Types

Damage has a number of different types and categories, which are described below.

## [[Physical Damage]]

Damage dealt by weapons, many physical hazards, and a handful of spells is collectively called physical damage. The main types of physical damage are bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. [[Bleed Damage]] is also a special type of physical Persistent Damage that represents loss of blood.

## Energy Damage

Many spells and other magical effects deal energy damage. Energy damage is also dealt from effects in the world, such as the biting cold of a blizzard to a raging forest fire. The main types of energy damage are [[Acid Damage|acid]], [[Cold Damage|cold]], [[Electricity Damage|electricity]], [[Fire Damage|fire]], [[Sonic Damage|sonic]], and [[Force Damage|force]]. Two special types of energy damage specifically target the living and the undead; [[Vitality Damage|vitality]] and [[Void Damage|void]].

Many times, you deal energy damage by casting magic spells, and doing so is often useful against creatures that have immunities or resistances to physical damage.

## [[Spirit Damage]]

Spirit damage doesn't harm creatures that have no spirit, such as constructs. It directly affects the spiritual essence of a creature.

## [[Mental Damage]]

Sometimes an effect can target the mind with enough psychic force to actually deal damage to the creature. When it does, it deals Mental damage.

## [[Poison Damage]]

Venoms, toxins and the like can deal poison damage, which affects creatures by way of contact, ingestion, inhalation, or injury.

## [[Precision Damage]]

Sometimes you are able to make the most of your attack through sheer precision. When you hit with an ability that grants you Precision damage, you increase the attack's listed damage, using the same damage type, rather than tracking a separate pool of damage.
