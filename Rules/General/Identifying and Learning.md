# Identification and Learning DCs

The DC to [[Identify Creature]], [[Identify Magic]], [[Identify Spell]], [[Identify Alchemy]], or [[Learn Spell]] with Recall Knowledge is usually the DC listed for the level or rank of the target, adjusted for its rarity and skill use.

DC = (Spell Rank DC or Target Level DC) + (Rarity or Difficulty Adjustment) + (Skill Adjustment)

Subsequent checks against the same target typically raise the DC (+2 to +5) at GMs discretion. The GM should ask what the player does differently to gain a new check.
