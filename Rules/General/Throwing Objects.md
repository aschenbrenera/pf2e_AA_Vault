# Throwing Objects

When you need to determine whether you can successfully throw something that doesn't have clear existing rules, you can use these generic rules.

## Mechanical Rules

- The object counts as an [[Fighting Unarmed|Improvised Weapon]].
	- If there is a similar enough weapon, use the statistics for that weapon.
	- If it is a simple object that is specifically designed to be thrown (such as a game ball), the GM may allow you to ignore the improvised weapon penalty.
- The object gains the 'Thrown' trait.
- The default range increment is typically 20 feet, modified at GM discretion.
- Attack Roll is a Ranged Strike and typically follows this format: (Dex + simple weapon proficiency â€“ 2)
- If targeting a point in space (rather than a creature or object), use an appropriate DC or AC, usually **AC 5** for an unoccupied square in normal conditions.
- Damage determined by the GM but is typically a d4.
