#  Fast Healing

## Mechanical Rules

- A creature with fast healing or regeneration regains the listed amount of Hit Points each round at the beginning of its turn. 
- A creature with regeneration has additional benefits. Its dying condition can’t increase to a value that would kill it as long as its regeneration is active.
- If it takes damage of a type listed in the regeneration entry, its regeneration deactivates until the end of its next turn.
