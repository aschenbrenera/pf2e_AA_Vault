#  Greater Darkvision

## Mechanical Rules

- A creature with [[Darkvision]] or Greater Darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of [[Darkness]] and [[Dim light]], though such vision is in black and white only.
- A creature with Greater Darkvision can also see through forms of magical darkness that block normal Darkvision.
