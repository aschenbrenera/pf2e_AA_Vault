# Echolocation

**Description**: Echolocation involves sensing creatures or objects by sound. This could mean its quarry is concealed in a noisy chamber, hidden in a great enough uproar, or invisible under a silence spell. Presented in stat blocks as 'echolocation (precise) x feet'.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use hearing as a [[Senses#Precise Sense|Precise Sense]] within a range as stated in ability or stat block.
	- The only way to target a creature without having drawbacks is to use a precise sense.
	 - You can usually detect a creature automatically with a precise sense making it [[Detection#Observed|Observed]]. 
		 -  It might still be [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] by you if it’s using Stealth or is in an environment that distorts the sense. In those cases, you have to use the [[Seek]] basic action to detect the creature.
