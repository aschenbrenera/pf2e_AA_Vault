#  Climb Speed

A Climb Speed allows you to move up or down inclines and vertical surfaces.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use the [[Climb]] action with the following benefits.
	- You are not Off-Guard while you're climbing.
	- You have a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb.
	- You can automatically succeed your check and move up to your Climb Speed instead of the maximum distance.
		- You can choose to roll an Athletics check to Climb rather than accept an automatic success in hopes of getting a critical success. 
		- You might still have to attempt Athletics checks to Climb in hazardous conditions, to Climb extremely difficult surfaces, or to cross horizontal planes such as ceilings.
