#  Fly Speed

A Fly Speed allows you to move through the air.

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use the [[Fly]] and [[Arrest a Fall]] actions.
- You can also attempt to [[Maneuver in Flight]] if you're trained in the Acrobatics skill.  
- Upward and downward movement are both relative to the gravity in your area; if you're in zero gravity, moving up or down is no different from moving horizontally.
