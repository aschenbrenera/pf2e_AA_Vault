#  Swim Speed

A Swim Speed allows you to propel yourself through the water with little impediment. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use the [[Swim]] action with the following benefits.
	- You have a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Swim.
	- You can automatically succeed your check and move up to your Swim Speed instead of the maximum distance.
		- You can choose to roll an Athletics check to Swim rather than accept an automatic success in hopes of getting a critical success. 
		- You might still have to attempt Athletics checks to Swim in hazardous conditions or to cross turbulent water.
	- Having a Swim Speed doesn't necessarily mean you can breathe in water, so you might still be [[Suffocating|Holding Breath]] if you're underwater to avoid drowning.
