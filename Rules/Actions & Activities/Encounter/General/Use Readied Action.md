# Use Readied Action (basic) [](#Actions "Reaction")

[Concentrate](Concentrate.md "General Trait")
**Description:** You execute the prepared action on the designated trigger.

**Trigger:** Specified during [[Ready]] action.
**Activity:** Reaction ⤾

## Mechanical Rules

- If the trigger you designated occurs before the start of your next turn, you can use the chosen action as a reaction (provided you still meet the requirements to use it).
- If you had a [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] when you readied an attack action, the readied attack uses that multiple attack penalty. This is one of the few times the multiple attack penalty applies when it's not your turn.
