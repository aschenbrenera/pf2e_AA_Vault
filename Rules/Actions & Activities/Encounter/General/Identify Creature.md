## Gameplay Tips

- For the purposes of abilities like mastermind rogue racket and ranger's [[Monster Hunter]], a character should be considered to have successfully identified a creature when they succeed a Recall Knowledge check, regardless of what information they gain.
- Example questions on creatures:  
	- What is the creature's combat tactics?
	- What are the creature's most notable vulnerabilities?   (Lowest Defensive DC; AC, Reflex, Fortitude, Will, or Weaknesses)
