# Point Out (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Auditory](Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait") [Visual](Visual.md "Effect Trait")

**Requirements:** A creature is [[Undetected]] by one or more of your allies but isn't undetected by you.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You indicate a creature that you can see to one or more allies, gesturing in a direction and describing the distance verbally.
	- This works only for allies who can see you and are in a position where they could potentially detect the target.
	- If your allies can't hear or understand you, they must succeed at a Perception check against the creature's [[Stealth]] DC or they misunderstand and believe the target is in a different location.
- That creature is now [[Hidden]] to your allies, rather than undetected.
