# Escape (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Attack](Attack.md "Combat Trait")
**Description:** You attempt to escape from being Grabbed, Immobilized, or Restrained. 

**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing [[Grabbed]], [[Immobilized]], or [[Restrained]] on you. 
	- The DC of the effect is typically the Athletics DC of a creature grabbing you, the [[Thievery]] DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment.
- Your check to escape is your unarmed attack modifier against the DC of the effect. You can attempt an [[Acrobatics]] or [[Athletics]] check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose but this action still has the `Attack` trait.  
- Attempt a check.
