# Fly (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Move](Move.md "General Trait")

**Requirements**: You have a fly Speed.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You move through the air up to your [[Fly Speed]].
- You can use an action to Fly 0 feet to hover in place.
- If you Fly to the ground, you don't take [[Falling|Falling Damage]].
- Your move distance is affected by wind conditions and direction
	- You can move straight down 10 feet for every 5 feet of movement you spend.
	- Moving with the wind allows you to move 10 feet for every 5 feet of movement you spend (not cumulative with moving straight downward).
	- Moving against the wind or upward (straight up or diagonally) uses the rules for moving through [[Difficult Terrain]], or Greater Difficult Terrain if both.
- If you're airborne at the end of your turn and didn't use a Fly action this round, you fall.
