# Mount (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Move](Move.md "General Trait")

**Requirement:** You are adjacent to a creature that is at least one size larger than you and is willing to be your mount.
**Activity:** Single Action â¬¥

## Mechanical Rules

- You move onto the creature and ride it.
- If you're already mounted, you can instead use this action to dismount, moving off the mount into a space adjacent to it.
