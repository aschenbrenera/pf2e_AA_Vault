# Swim (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Move](Move.md "General Trait")

**Skill:** [[Athletics]] (Untrained)
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You can't be knocked prone when Swim.
- Moving up or down is moving through Difficult Terrain.
- If you end your turn in water and haven't succeeded at a Swim action that turn, you sink 10 feet or get moved by the current, as determined by the GM. This doesn't apply if your last action on your turn was to enter the water.  
- When you make a Swim check, you move a maximum distance of 10 feet through water. 
	- If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the maximum possible distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of Speed above 20 feet.  
- The GM determines the DC based on the turbulence or danger of the water; in most instances of calm water, you get an automatic critical success.
- Attempt an Athletics check:
  > [!success-degree]
  > - **Critical Success:** You move through the water, increasing the maximum distance by 5 feet.  
  > - **Success:** You move through the water.  
  > - **Critical Failure:** You make no progress. If you're [[Suffocating|Holding Breath]], you lose 1 round of air.

### Sample Swim Tasks

| **Proficiency Rank** | **DC** | Task                        |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Untrained            | 10     | lake or other still water   |
| Trained              | 15     | flowing water, like a river |
| Expert               | 20     | swiftly flowing river       |
| Master               | 30     | stormy sea                  |
| Legendary            | 40     | maelstrom, waterfall        |

## Gameplay Interaction

- If you have a [[Swim Speed]], you can use the Swim action with the following benefits.
	- You have a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Swim.
	- You can automatically succeed your check and move up to your Swim Speed instead of the maximum distance.
		- You can choose to roll an Athletics check to Swim rather than accept an automatic success in hopes of getting a critical success. 
		- You might still have to attempt Athletics checks to Swim in hazardous conditions or to cross turbulent water.
	- Having a Swim Speed doesn't necessarily mean you can breathe in water, so you might still be [[Suffocating|Holding Breath]] if you're underwater to avoid drowning.
