# Burrow (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Move](Move.md "General Trait")

**Requirements:** You have a burrow Speed.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You dig your way through dirt, sand, or a similar loose material at a rate up to your [[Burrow Speed]].
- You can't burrow through rock or other substances denser than dirt unless you have an ability that allows you to do so.
- Burrowing doesn’t normally leave behind a tunnel unless the ability specifically states that it does.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Most creatures are [[Suffocating|Holding Breath]] when burrowing, and they might need [[Tremorsense]] to navigate.
