# Climb (basic) [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Move](Move.md "General Trait")

**Skill:** [[Athletics]] (Untrained)
**Requirements:** You have two hands free.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You're [[Off-Guard]] while climbing.
	- You take a –2 circumstance penalty to AC.
- When you make a Climb check, you move a maximum distance of 5 feet up, down, or across an incline. 
	- If your land Speed is 40 feet or higher, increase the maximum distance by 5 feet for every 20 feet of Speed above 20 feet. 
- The GM determines the DC based on the nature of the incline and environmental circumstances; you might get an automatic critical success on an incline that's trivial to climb. 
- Attempt an Athletics check.

## Gameplay Interaction

- If you have a [[Climb Speed]], you can use the Climb action with the following benefits.
	- You are not Off-Guard while you're climbing.
	- You have a +4 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Climb.
	- You can automatically succeed your check and move up to your Climb Speed instead of the maximum distance.
		- You can choose to roll an Athletics check to Climb rather than accept an automatic success in hopes of getting a critical success. 
		- You might still have to attempt Athletics checks to Climb in hazardous conditions, to Climb extremely difficult surfaces, or to cross horizontal planes such as ceilings.
