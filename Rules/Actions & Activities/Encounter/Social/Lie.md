# Lie [](#Actions "Three-Action")

[Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait")  [Auditory](Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Linguistic](Linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](Mental.md "Effect Trait") [Secret](Secret.md "General Trait") 
**Description:** You try to fool someone with an untruth. 

**Skill:** [[Deception]]
**Activity:** Three Action ⬥⬥⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- Lying takes at least 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate.
- The GM might give a creature a circumstance bonus based on the situation and the nature of the lie you are trying to tell. Elaborate or highly unbelievable lies are much harder to get a creature to believe than simpler and more believable lies, and some lies are so big that it's impossible to get anyone to believe them.  
- You roll a single [[Deception]] check and compare it against the Perception DC of every creature you are trying to fool.
	- **Success:** The target believes your lie.  
	- **Failure:** The target doesn't believe your lie and gains a +4 circumstance bonus against your attempts to Lie for the duration of your conversation. The target is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
- At the GM's discretion, if a creature initially believes your lie, it might attempt a Perception check later to [[Sense Motive]] against your Deception DC to realize it's a lie. This usually happens if the creature discovers enough evidence to counter your statements.  

## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Linguistic]] trait.
	- A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.
