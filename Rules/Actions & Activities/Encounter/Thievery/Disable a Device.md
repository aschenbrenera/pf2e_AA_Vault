# Disable a Device [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait")
**Description:** This action allows you to disarm a trap or another complex device. 

**Skill:** [[Thievery]] (Trained)
**Requirements:** You are trained in Thievery.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- A [[Thieves' Toolkit]] is helpful and sometimes even required to Disable a Device, as determined by the GM, and sometimes a device requires a higher proficiency rank in Thievery to disable it.  
- Often, a device requires numerous successes before becoming disabled, depending on its construction and complexity. Your attempted Thievery check result determines your progress.
