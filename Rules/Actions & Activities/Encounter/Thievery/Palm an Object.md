## Skill Feats

| Level | Feat             | Req. Training    | Short Desc.                                      |
| ----- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | [[Pickpocket]]   | Trained Thievery | Better at taking guarded objects.                |
| 1     | [[Subtle Theft]] | Trained Thievery | Better at taking items while avoiding detection. |

## Gameplay Tips

- The Pickpocket feat implies that unattended objects still might be otherwise protected. In that case, it may be appropriate to increase the DCs by 5.
