# Investigate

[Exploration](Exploration.md "General Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "General Trait") `Exploration Tactic`
**Description:** You seek out information about your surroundings

## Mechanical Rules

-  Move up to half your [[Travel speed]].
- You use [[Recall Knowledge]] to discover clues among the various things you can see and engage with as you journey along. You can use any skill that has a Recall Knowledge action while Investigating, but the GM determines whether the skill is relevant to the clues you could find.
