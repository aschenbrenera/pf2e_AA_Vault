# Avoid Notice

[Exploration](Exploration.md "General Trait") `Exploration Tactic`
**Description:** Explore stealthily. 

**Skill:** [[Stealth]] (Untrained)

## Mechanical Rules

- Travel at half speed.
-  If you're Avoiding Notice at the start of an encounter, you usually are allowed to roll a Stealth check instead of a Perception check both to determine your initiative and to see if the enemies notice you.
	- All the normal Stealth check bonuses and penalties apply, including any bonus for having [[Cover]].
	- You can roll Perception instead, but you forsake Stealth and become Observed.
	- To determine your [[Detection]] level by enemies, you compare your Stealth check for initiative to the Perception DC of all enemies (as normal for [[Sneak]]).

> [!success-degree] 
>- **Success:** You're [[Undetected]] by the creature.  If you start your first turn Undetected by all enemies, the GM determines if you are also [[Detection|Unnoticed]].
>- **Failure:** You're [[Hidden]] from the creature.
>- **Critical Failure:** You're [[Detection|Observed]] by the creature. If you're Invisible you are Hidden instead.
	

> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
>There is some debate on the following. The written rules don't implicitly give any benefit for Avoiding Notice until the call for initiative. That being said, the following tabletop rule seems to be widely adopted.
>- When undertaking the Avoid Notice activity, make an exploration Stealth check (secret at GM discretion).
>	- The GM decides how far or how long that check is used during exploration. Typically the check can be rerolled when any relevant circumstance has changed.
>	- The GM may compare this check to the Perception DC of enemies to determine detection during exploration.
>		- Success does not guarantee avoidance of an encounter, but the GM may use it to change how and when it unfolds.
>		- Regardless of whether they are noticed during exploration, all creatures who were trying to Avoid Notice should be allowed to roll Stealth for initiative when an encounter starts.


## Gameplay Interaction

- Rogues have a feature called [[Surprise Attack]] that can be triggered by Avoid Notice.
	- On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are Off-Guard to you.

## Gameplay Tip

- There are no 'Surprise Round' rules in PF2e.
- A more comprehensive GM description of Avoid Notice can be found in [[Entering Initiative with Stealth|Stealth into Encounter]] .
