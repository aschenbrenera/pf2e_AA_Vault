# Cover Tracks

[Exploration](Exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Move](Move.md "General Trait") `Exploration Tactic`
**Description:** You cover your tracks.

**Skill:** [[Survival]] (Trained)
**Requirements:** You are trained in Survival.

## Mechanical Rules

- In some cases, you might Cover Tracks in an encounter. In this case, Cover Tracks is a single action and doesn't have the exploration trait.
- Move up to half your [[Travel speed]].
- You don't need to attempt a Survival check to cover your tracks, but anyone attempting to [[Track]] you must succeed at a Survival check against your Survival DC if it is higher than the normal DC to Track.
