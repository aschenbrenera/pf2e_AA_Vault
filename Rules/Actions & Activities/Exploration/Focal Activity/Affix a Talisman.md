# Affix A Talisman

[Exploration](Exploration.md "General Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait")

**Requirements:** You must use a [[Repair Toolkit]].

## Mechanical Rules

- You spend 10 minutes affixing a [talisman](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=155) to an item, placing the item on a stable surface and using the repair toolkit with both hands.
	- You can also use this activity to remove a talisman.
- Attaching more than one talisman to an item deactivates all the talismans. They must be removed and re-affixed before they can be used again.
