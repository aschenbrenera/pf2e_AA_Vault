## Gameplay Interaction

- Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of [[Attitudes]] that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. 
	- [[Helpful]]: Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests.
	- [[Friendly]]: Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
	- [[Indifferent]]: Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.)
	- [[Unfriendly]]: Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you.
	- [[Hostile]]: Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.
- Follows the rules for the `Linguistic` trait.
	- A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.
