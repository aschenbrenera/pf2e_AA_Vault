#  Forensic Examination

[Exploration](Exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "General Trait") [Secret](Secret.md "General Trait")
**Description:** You methodically examine a corpse, scene of death, or other medical evidence to determine how an injury or condition occurred. You analyze trauma, poisons, diseases, magical effects, or other symptoms that left physiological signs.

**Skill:** [[Medicine]] (Untrained)

## Mechanical Rules

 - This is a a specialized type ofÂ [[Recall Knowledge]].
 - During exploration, you can spend at least 10 minutes studying a body to possibly identify cause of injury, illness, or death.
 - With a critical success or prolonged examination (at least an hour), you may determine additional information such as:
	- Type of weapon or attack used
	- Presence of poisons, diseases, or magical afflictions
	- Whether wounds were self-inflicted, accidental, or deliberate
	- Approximate time of death
- The DC is determined by the obscurity or complexity of the condition or cause.
- The GM rolls a secret Medicine check to Recall Knowledge based on the clues available.
