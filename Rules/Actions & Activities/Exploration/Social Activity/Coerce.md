# Coerce

[Exploration](Exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait")  [Auditory](Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Emotion](Emotion.md "Effect Trait") [Linguistic](Linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](Mental.md "Effect Trait") 
**Description:** With threats either veiled or overt, you attempt to bully a creature into doing what you want. 

**Skill:** [[Intimidation]] (Untrained)

## Mechanical Rules

- You spend at least 1 minute of conversation with a creature while not in combat. At the end of the conversation, attempt a Intimidation check against the Will DC of one target.

> [!success-degree] 
>- **Critical Success:**
>	- The target gives you the information you seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they aren't likely to harm the target in any way.
>	- The target continues to comply for an amount of time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target becomes Unfriendly (if it wasn't already unfriendly or Hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to retaliate—at least in the short term.
>- **Success:** As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against you—for example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting your enemies.  
>- **Failure:** The target doesn't do what you say, and if they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.  
>- **Critical Failure:** The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile if they weren't already, and is temporarily immune to your Coercion for at least 1 week.

> [!tip] Alternate Tabletop Rule
> You can incorporate the benefits of the following feats directly into the action itself, making them available to all players: **[[Group Coercion]], [[Quick Coercion]], and [[Lasting Coercion]].**
> - If you are trained in Intimidation, you can target up to 5 creatures instead of one, and reduce the required amount of conversation to a single a round.
> - If you are expert in Intimidation, you can target up to 10 creatures, and the maximum time they comply increases to a week.
> - If you are master in Intimidation, you can target up to 20 creatures.
> - If you are legendary in Intimidation, you can target up to 50 creatures, and the maximum time they comply increases to a month.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. 
	- [[Helpful]]: Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests.
	- [[Friendly]]: Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you.
	- [[Indifferent]]: Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.)
	- [[Unfriendly]]: Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you.
	- [[Hostile]]: Actively works against you—and might attack you just because of their dislike.
- Follows the rules for the `Linguistic` trait.
	- A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.
