# Session 5

## Into the Cavern

Lumii stealthily scouts ahead into the cavern. She sees a dim red light radiating from a stone pillar in the cave. She approaches the pillar and the party slowly follows in behind. Thyra casts Mage Armor. The group investigates the glowing pillar. Gunther touches the pillar, which only feels cold to the touch. We move deeper into the cavern. Thyra begins to hear the sounds of battle seemingly coming from nowhere. She is drawn to touch the pillar, where she then has a vision of being killed in battle, and feels a deep streak of fear.
Lumii doesn't notice the precarious state of the ceiling, and walks right under it as a few small boulders fall on her. She's hurt, but the party continues on, and Lumii dodges the next patch of debris that falls, as we enter a large cavern. The whole cavern glows red, emanating from the marble in every wall. Lumii sees a nearby dark passage, and leads us down it searching for danger. She dodges out of the way of more falling debris. 

## Little Blues
As we enter the next chamber, Lumii sees a little blue person with long ears. She immediately attempts a friendly greeting. The party rushes in to see who Lumii is talking to and Thyra walks under some falling rubble.

Lumii walks into the chamber to see another couple of little blue people and a glowing beetle. She tells the little blue people that we are here to find out what happened to the miners. The leader of the blue people (named Olin) tell us that the marble has been glowing red for years. They little blue people have reached an agreement with Morkal, an undead warrior. Morkal will kill the little blue people if they don't keep strangers from his tomb.

Gunther is able to determine the little blue people are Fey and Thyra knows these are mitflits, lesser gremlins. 

We agree to eliminate Morkal for the miflits. The miflits also agree to leave the mines if we pay them 10 gold. Gunther hand them 10 gold. They warn us of something dangerous at the entrance to the passage on the other side of large cavern.
