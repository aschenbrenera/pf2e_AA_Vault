# Session 4

## Arriving at the mine

We arrive at the mine and ask to see [[Frostbreach#Lord Ivar Barrelsbane|Lord Barrelsbane]], and the mine guards escort us. The camp at the mine exterior is nearly military in it's configuration. We haggle with Lord Barrelsbane to an agreed to a total sum of 150 gp to clear the mine (10 gp less for Taghira for dumping the lord's vodka). We learn that a total of three miners have gone missing and are likely dead. Also that the mining operation is using a priest of magirm to find marble. We are directed to get further information from the foreman [[Frostbreach#Steinar Ironmike|Steinar Ironmike]]. The foreman confirms all the information we've received before, and directs us to the cavern.


## Down into the mine

We light Thyra's lantern and head down into the mine. Lummi sneaks ahead in the shadows beyond the lantern's light. She looks for hazards and guides us deeper into the mine until we reach the spot that enters into the natural caverns. The cave emanates a notable chill. Thyra uses detect magic and can tell there is an aura of magic coming from the cave, and can see her party all has some magic items. The party prepares for the unknown and heads into the cavern.
