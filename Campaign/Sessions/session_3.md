## The party preps for the mine

The next morning, everyone has a long morning of routines and errands and then meets at the pre-arranged spot at the village gates. The group chats as they walk to the mine. They pass a group of miners heading to Frostbreach. The miners freely tell us about lights, sounds of battle, screaming, and laughing coming from the discovered chamber. We finish our conversation and resume our walk to the mine.
