### Natural Medicine Ideas

- Battle Medicine
	- Caph Pods - when crushed release a think potent vapor that when inhaled sends a jolt of vitality through their body, but taxes the system. More than 1 a day is not recommended.
	- Shockroot Paste - when slathered over a wound it stings at first but will stop the bleeding and the paste, then works as a general anesthetic. More then one application a day can cause cardiac arrest.
- Treat wounds
	- Mint and Lichen Salves to each swelling and help close wounds.
	- Brew restorative Tea from herbs.
