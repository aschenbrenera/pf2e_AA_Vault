## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Rules/Traits/Item/Weapon Trait/Shove|Shove]]
	-  You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand.
		- This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check.
		- If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.
- Critical Specialization - [[Hammer Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- The target is knocked prone unless they succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC.
