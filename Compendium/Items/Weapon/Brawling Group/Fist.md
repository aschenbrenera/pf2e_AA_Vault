## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Agile]]
	- The [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
	- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.
- [[Finesse]]
	- You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.
- Critical Specialization - [[Brawling Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- The target must succeed at a Fortitude save against your class DC or be [[Slowed]] 1 until the end of your next turn.
