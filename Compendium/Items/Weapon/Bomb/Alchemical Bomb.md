## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Thrown]] 20 Ft.
	- You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown.
	- You add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon.
	- When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.
		- Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.
- [[Bomb]]
	- When you throw a bomb, you make a weapon attack roll against the target's AC, as you would for any other weapon.
	    - It takes one hand to draw, prepare, and throw a bomb.
	    - The bomb is activated when thrown as a Strike; you don't have to activate it separately.
	- As consumables, bombs can't have runes etched onto them, have talismans attached to them, or benefit from runes granted in other ways (such as from spells or from items that replicate runes from other items).
	    - Spells and magic items that give you a bonus to all your attacks (or to all thrown weapons, for example) can still apply to them.
- Critical Specialization - [[Bomb Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- Increase the radius of the bomb's splash damage (if any) to 10 feet.
