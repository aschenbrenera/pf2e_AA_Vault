# Ghoul Stiletto &emsp;*(Item 3)*

[Magical](Rules/Traits/Effect/Magical.md "Item Trait") [Agile](Agile.md "Weapon Trait") [Finesse](Finesse.md "Weapon Trait") [Versatile _S_](Versatile.md "Weapon Trait") [Thrown _10 FT._](Thrown.md "Weapon Trait")

A _ghoul stiletto_ is dagger wrapped in the still-undead skin of a ghoul.

**Price:** 60 gp
**Bulk:** L
**Hands:** 1

**Category:** Simple
**Type:** Melee
**Group:** Knife
**Damage** 1d4 P

## Mechanical Rules

- +1 [[Dagger]]
- While you wield the dagger, you gain a +1 status bonus to all saves against Curses and Olfactory effects.
- **Activate:** [](#Actions "Single Action") (concentrate, divine, manipulate, olfactory); **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** The _ghoul stiletto_ afflicts the next living target struck by the dagger with a terrible wound that emits the foul stench of the grave. The creature emits a stench aura in a 10-foot emanation for 1 minute. During that time, the affected creature, as well as any creature that starts or ends its turn in the aura, must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become sickened 1 (plus slowed 1 as long as it’s sickened on a critical failure). A creature that succeeds at its save is temporarily immune to all stench auras for 1 minute.
- **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include skin from a ghoul.

## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Agile]]
	- The [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
	- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.
- [[Finesse]]
	- You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.
- [[Versatile]] S
	- A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. This trait indicates the alternate damage type.
	- For instance, a piercing weapon with versatile S can deal piercing or slashing damage. 
	- You choose the damage type each time you attack.
- [[Thrown]] 10 Ft.
	- You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown.
	- You add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon.
	- When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.
		- Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.
- Critical Specialization - [[Knife Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- The target takes 1d6 [[Persistent Damage|Persistent]] [[Bleed Damage]]. You gain an item bonus to this bleed damage equal to the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls.
		- Bleed Damage is persistent damage that represents loss of blood.
			- As such, it has no effect on nonliving creatures or living creatures that don't need blood to live.
			- Weaknesses and resistances to physical damage apply.
			- Bleed damage ends automatically if you're healed to your full Hit Points.
