## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Agile]]
	- The [[Multiple Attack Penalty]] you take with this weapon on the second attack on your turn is –4 instead of –5, and –8 instead of –10 on the third and subsequent attacks in the turn.
	- This reduction doesn't affect future attacks with non-agile weapons.
- [[Sweep]]
	- When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.
- [[Thrown]] 10 Ft.
	- You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown.
	- You add your Strength modifier to damage as you would for a melee weapon.
	- When this trait appears on a melee weapon, it also includes the range increment.
		- Ranged weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.
- Critical Specialization - [[Axe Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its _striking_ rune, if any).
		- This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.
