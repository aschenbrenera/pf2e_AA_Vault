## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Finesse]]
	- You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls using this melee weapon. You still calculate damage using Strength.
- [[Forceful]]
	- When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each later attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of damage dice.
- Critical Specialization - [[Sword Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn.
