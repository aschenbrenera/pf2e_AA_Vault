# Hand Crossbow

Sometimes referred to as an alley bow by rogues or ruffians, this small crossbow fires small bolts that are sometimes used to deliver poison to the target. It's small enough to be shot one-handed, but it still requires two hands to load.

**Category:** Simple
**Type:** Ranged
**Ammunition:** [[Bolts]]

## Gameplay Interaction

- Critical Specialization - [[Crossbow Group]] (when granted by an ability)
	- If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile.
		- The target is Immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is Incorporeal, is liquid, or could otherwise escape without effort.
