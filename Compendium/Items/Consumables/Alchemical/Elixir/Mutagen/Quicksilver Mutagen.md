# Quicksilver Mutagen

[Consumable](Consumable.md "Item Trait") [Alchemical](Alchemical.md "Item Trait") [Elixir](Elixir.md "Item Trait") [Mutagen](Mutagen.md "Item Trait") [Polymorph](Polymorph.md "Effect Trait")
 
**Bulk:** L
**Hand Usage:** Held in 1 hand
**Activate:** [](#Actions "Single Action") (manipulate)

You become swifter and nimbler but also fragile.
  
- **Benefit:** You gain an item bonus to Acrobatics checks, Stealth checks, Thievery checks, Reflex saves, and Dexterity-based attack rolls, and you gain the listed status bonus to your Speed.  
- **Drawback:** You take damage equal to twice your level; you can't recover Hit Points lost in this way by any means while the mutagen lasts. You take a –2 penalty to Fortitude saves.
