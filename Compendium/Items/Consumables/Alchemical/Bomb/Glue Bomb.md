# Glue Bomb

[Consumable](Consumable.md "Item Trait") [Alchemical](Alchemical.md "Item Trait") [Bomb](Bomb.md "Item Trait")
 
**Bulk:** L
**Hand Usage:** held in 1 hand
**Activate:** [](#Actions "Single Action") Strike

A glue bomb is a harmless explosive mechanism bursting with sticky substances. 

- When you hit a creature with a glue bomb, that creature takes a status penalty to its Speeds for 1 minute.  
- On a critical hit, a creature in contact with a solid surface becomes stuck to the surface and [[Immobilized]] for 1 round. 
	- A creature flying via wings has its wings tangled, causing it to fall safely to the ground and become unable to Fly again for 1 round. Glue bombs aren't effective when used on a creature that's in water.  
- The target can end any effects via [[Escape]] or spending a total of 3 `Manipulate` actions to carefully remove the sticky substances. These manipulate actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can provide the actions as well.
