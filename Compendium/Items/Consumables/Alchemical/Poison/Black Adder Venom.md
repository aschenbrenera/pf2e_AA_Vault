## Gameplay Interaction

- [[Injury]]
	- An injury poison is activated by applying it to a weapon or ammunition, and it affects the target of the first Strike made using the poisoned item.
	    - If that Strike is a success and deals **piercing** or **slashing** damage, the target must attempt a saving throw against the poison.
	    - On a failed Strike, the target is unaffected, but the poison remains on the weapon and you can try again.
	    - On a critical failure, or if the Strike fails to deal slashing or piercing damage for some other reason, the poison is spent but the target is unaffected.
	- Only one injury poison can be applied to a weapon or ammunition at a time.
- [[Afflictions]]
	> [!success-degree]
	> - **Critical Success:** Reduce the stage by 2. Take effects of that stage.
    > - **Success:** Reduce the stage by 1. Take effects of that stage.
    > - **Failure:** Stage Increases by 1. Take effects of that stage.
    > - **Critical Failure:** Stage Increases by 2. Take effects of that stage.

## Gameplay Tips

- Once applied, an injury poison remains _on the weapon_ until triggered (successful hit + proper damage) or until a Strike that causes it to be expended (critical failure or wrong damage type).
