# Hunter's Bane &emsp;*(Item 2)*

[Consumable](Consumable.md "Item Trait") [Magical](Rules/Traits/Effect/Magical.md "Item Trait") [Talisman](Talisman.md "Item Trait") [Detection](Detection.md "Effect Trait")

**Price:** 6 gp
**Bulk:** —
**Usage:** Affixed to armor
**Requirements:** You're trained in Survival.
**Activate** (concentrate)
**Trigger:** A Hidden or Undetected enemy hits you with an Attack.


This talisman is a ring of dried, interwoven pieces of straw. 

## Mechanical Rules

- When you activate the _hunter's bane_, you sense the exact location of the attacker.
- It becomes Observed by you if it was Hidden from you or becomes Hidden from you if it was Undetected. 
- If the attacker is behind lead, the _hunter's bane_ has no effect.

## Gameplay Tips

- This trinket is not useful against typical stealth, as attacker's already reveal themselves during an attack. This trinket is best used against attackers who are effectively invisible to you, either because they can't be seen, or because you can't see.
- While it doesn't explicitly say it, if there is any ambiguity to the duration of the effect, allow it to last until the end of the wearer's next turn.
