# Vine Arrow &emsp;*(Item 3)*

[Consumable](Consumable.md "Item Trait") [Magical](Rules/Traits/Effect/Magical.md "Item Trait")

**Price:** 10 gp
**Bulk:** —
**Ammunition"** [[Arrows]]
**Activate:** [](#Actions "Single Action") (concentrate)


Leafy stalks protrude from the shaft of this rustic arrow. When an activated _vine arrow_ hits a target, the arrow's shaft splits and grows, wrapping the target in vines.

## Mechanical Rules

- The target takes a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds for 2d4 rounds, or until it succeeds a [[Escape]] action against a DC of 19. 
- On a critical hit, the target is also [[Immobilized]] until it Escapes.
