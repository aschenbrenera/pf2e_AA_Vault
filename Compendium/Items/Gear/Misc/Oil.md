# Oil

You can use oil to fuel lanterns, but you can also set a pint of oil aflame and throw it. 

You must first spend an Interact action preparing the oil, then throw it with another action as a ranged attack.  If you hit, it splatters on the creature or in a single 5-foot square you target. You must succeed at a DC 10 flat check for the oil to ignite successfully when it hits. 
If the oil ignites, the target takes 1d6 [[Fire Damage]].

## Gameplay Interaction

 - Throwing Objects
	 - The default range increment is typically 20 feet, modified at GM discretion.
	- Attack Roll is a Ranged Strike and typically follows this format: (Dex + simple weapon proficiency – 2)
	- If targeting a point in space (rather than a creature or object), use an appropriate DC or AC, usually **AC 5** for an unoccupied square in normal conditions.
