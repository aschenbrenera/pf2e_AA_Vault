# Expeditious Search &emsp;*(Feat 7)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You have a system that lets you search at great speed, finding details and secrets twice as quickly as others can.

**Prerequisite:** Master in Perception.

## Mechanical Rules

- This feat allows you to [[Search]] twice as quickly. These are your new limits.
	- If your searching speed is greater than 30 feet (300 feet per minute), you can't ensure you check everything before you walk into it ([[Detecting Hazards and Traps]]).
	- If your searching speed is greater than 60 feet (600 feet per minute), you can't search thoroughly guaranteeing you checked everything.
	- If you’re legendary in Perception, double the above limits.
