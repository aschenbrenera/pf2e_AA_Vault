# Thorough Search &emsp;*(Feat 3)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You take your time searching to ensure you find everything.

## Mechanical Rules

- When using [[Search]], you can take twice as long to search.
	- Normally this means you Search at up to one quarter of your Speed, to a maximum of 150 feet per minute to check everything, or 75 feet per minute to check everything before you walk into an area.
	- If you do and the GM rolls your secret check to Seek to notice something, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to that Perception check and if you succeed, you get a critical success instead.
