# Prescient Planner &emsp;*(Feat 3)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You regularly create convoluted plans and contingencies, using your resources to enact them. You have an item that you intuited that you would come to need and purchased it at the latest opportunity. 
**Requirements** You haven’t used this ability since the last time you were able to purchase goods. You expend the cost of the chosen item.

## Mechanical Rules

-  You take 1 minute to remove your backpack, then carefully remove an item you hadn’t previously declared that you purchased.
	- The item must be a piece of adventuring gear and can’t be a weapon, armor, alchemical item, magic item, or other treasure.
	- It must be common with a level no higher than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn’t have made you encumbered.
