# Robust Health &emsp;*(Feat 3)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:**  Your physiology responds well to first aid.

## Mechanical Rules

- You gain a circumstance bonus to the number of Hit Points you regain equal to your level from a successful attempt of [[Treat Wounds]] or [[Battle Medicine]] on you.
- After you or an ally use Battle Medicine on you, you become temporarily immune to that Battle Medicine for only 1 hour, instead of 1 day.
