# Cat's Luck[](#Actions "Reaction") &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[Catfolk](Catfolk.md "Ancestry & Heritage Trait") [Fortune](Fortune.md "Effect Trait")
**Description:** You instinctively twist away from danger.

**Prerequisite:** Catfolk
**Frequency:** once per day
**Trigger:** You fail a Reflex saving throw
**Activity:** Reaction ⤾

## Mechanical Rules

- Reroll the triggering saving throw and use the better result.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Fortune]] trait.
	- A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. 
	- A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it.
	- If a fortune effect and a mis effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
