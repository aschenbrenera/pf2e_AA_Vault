# First World Magic  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[Gnome](Gnome.md "Ancestry & Heritage Trait")
**Description:** Your connection to the First World grants you a primal innate spell, much like those of the fey. 
**Prerequisite:** Gnome

## Mechanical Rules

- Choose one cantrip from the Primal spell list.
	- You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will.
	- A cantrip is heightened to a spell rank equal to half your level rounded up.
