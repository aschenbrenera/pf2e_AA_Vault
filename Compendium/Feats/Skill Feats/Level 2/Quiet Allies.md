# Quiet Allies  &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** You’re skilled at moving stealthily with a group.

**Prerequisites:** Expert in [[Stealth]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Avoid Notice]] and your allies [[Follow the Expert]], you and those allies can roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately.
	- This doesn’t apply for initiative rolls.


> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
>As stated in the entry for Avoid Notice, the written rules only gives a benefit when calling for initiative. When a group is using Quiet Allies, all members of the group roll their stealth check for initiative, but only use the check result of the ally with the lowest modifier to determine detection for the entire group.
>
>If you are using the tabletop rule for "exploration Stealth", you can apply the benefit of Quiet Allies to the exploration Stealth check.
