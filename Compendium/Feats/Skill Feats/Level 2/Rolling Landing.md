# Rolling Landing &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You land with quick rolls that help you keep your momentum.

**Prerequisites:** [[Cat Fall]]

## Mechanical Rules

- If you [[Falling|Fall]] and don't take damage (usually due to treating the fall as a shorter distance), you can use your reaction to immediately enter a short roll when you land and [[Step]].
	- If you are an expert in [[Acrobatics]], you can instead use your reaction to Step or [[Stride]] up to half your Speed. 
	- If you're a master in Acrobatics, you can instead use this reaction to Step or Stride up to your full Speed.
	- If you're legendary in Acrobatics, you also don't trigger reactions triggered by movement when you Stride in this way.
