# Continual Recovery &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You zealously monitor a patient’s progress to administer treatment faster.

**Prerequisites:** Expert in [[Medicine]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Treat Wounds]], your patient becomes immune for only 10 minutes instead of 1 hour.
	- This applies only to your Treat Wounds activities, not any other the patient receives.
