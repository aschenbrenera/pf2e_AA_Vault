## Gameplay Tips

- By default rules, spells in this game can only be turned into Scrolls, not potions. But if you want a non-caster character (without 'trick magic item') to have access to a specific spell, you may want to convert a spell into a custom potion item. If necessary, take the spell increase it's level by 1 and then use the [[Consumable]] price chart.
