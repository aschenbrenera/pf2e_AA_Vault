# Confabulator &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie.

**Prerequisites:** Expert in [[Deception]]

## Mechanical Rules

- Reduce the circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts to [[Create a Diversion]] or [[Lie]] to it from +4 to +2.
- If you’re a master in Deception, reduce the bonus to +1, and if you’re legendary, your targets don’t get these bonuses at all.
