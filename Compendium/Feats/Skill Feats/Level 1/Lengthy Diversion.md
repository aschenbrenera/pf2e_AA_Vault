# Lengthy Diversion &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** Can extend your hidden duration after a diversion.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Deception]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you critically succeed to [[Create a Diversion]], you continue to remain hidden after the end of your turn.
	- This effect lasts for an amount of time that depends on the diversion and situation, as determined by the GM (minimum 1 additional round).


> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
> This feat is slightly underwhelming. If you want to increase the impact of taking this feat, also include the following benefits. 
> - You may Create a Diversion using two actions instead of one to gain a +1 circumstance bonus on the deception check. The bonus increases to +2 if you’re a master.
