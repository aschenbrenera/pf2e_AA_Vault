# Group Coercion &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You can strong-arm people effectively, even when you don’t have them isolated.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Intimidation]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Coerce]], you can compare your [[Intimidation]] check result to the Will DCs of up to five targets instead of one.  
	- It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. 
	- The number of targets you can Coerce in a single action increases to 10 if you’re an expert, 25 if you’re a master, and 50 if you’re legendary.


> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
> This appears to be feat tax for what should essentially be base game functionality.  Alternate rules are given under Coerce that fold this feat into the action itself.
