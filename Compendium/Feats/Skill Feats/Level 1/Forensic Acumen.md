# Forensic Acumen &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You understand principles of forensic medicine, making you better at examining a body to determine the cause of death or injury.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Medicine]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You can perform a [[Forensic Examination]] on a body (a special [[Recall Knowledge]] check), in half the normal amount of time (to a minimum of 5 minutes).
	- If you succeed at your check, you can attempt an immediate check to Recall Knowledge to follow up on something you found, with a +2 circumstance bonus.
		- The circumstance bonus increases to +3 if you have master proficiency in Medicine and +4 if you have legendary proficiency.
		- This check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such as a Crafting check to identify a poison or weapon used or an additional Medicine check to identify a specific disease.
		- If you prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall Knowledge about the type of creature whose body you examined, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus.
