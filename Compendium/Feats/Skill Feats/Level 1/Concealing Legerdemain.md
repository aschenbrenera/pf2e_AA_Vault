# Concealing Legerdemain  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won't search, you're skilled at keeping the object on the move so it's never where they look.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Thievery]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Conceal an Object]] of light Bulk or less, you can use [[Thievery]] instead of Stealth for your checks and for the DC of an active searcher's Perception check.
- You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.
