# Concealing Legerdemain  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** Rather than hide an object somewhere the inspectors won't search, you're skilled at keeping the object on the move so it's never where they look.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Thievery]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Conceal an Object]] of light Bulk or less, you can use [[Thievery]] instead of Stealth for your checks and for the DC of an active searcher's Perception check.
	- You roll the check only once, but you must continue to use actions to Conceal an Object throughout the process.

> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
> This feat is generally underwhelming. If you want to increase the impact of taking this feat, also include the following benefits. 
> - If you are also trained in Deception, when being actively searched you may gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Thievery DC against one creature searching you.
> 	- If you’re an expert in Thievery you gain the circumstance bonus against all creatures searching you.
