# Courtly Graces &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence and politics.

**Prerequisites:**Â Trained in [[Society]]

## Mechanical Rules

- Unless you are intentionally presenting yourself differently, anyone who speaks with you will assume you are a noble or closely associated with the nobility (such as a prominent servant). 
- You can use [[Society]] to [[Make an Impression]] on a noble.
- You can use [[Society]] to [[Impersonate]] a type of noble or a specific individual noble.
- If you use the normal skills in those situations, you receive a +1 circumstance bonus to the check instead.
