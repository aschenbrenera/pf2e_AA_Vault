# Group Impression &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** Increase the number of targets you can influence at once.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Diplomacy]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you [[Make an Impression]], you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of up to 10 targets you conversed with, with no penalty.
- The number of targets increases to 20 if you’re an expert, 50 if you’re a master, and 100 if you’re legendary.

> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
> This appears to be feat tax for what should essentially be base game functionality.  Alternate rules are given under Make an Impression that fold this feat into the action itself.
