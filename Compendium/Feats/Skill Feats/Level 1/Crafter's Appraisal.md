# Crafter's Appraisal &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** Your knowledge of items' construction allows you to discern their magical effects as well. 

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Crafting]].

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use [[Crafting]] instead of a skill associated with a magic tradition to [[Identify Magic]]Â on magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.
