# Deceptive Worship &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** Members of your cult frequently pass themselves off as worshippers of other religions.

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Occultism]].

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use Occultism instead of Deception to [[Impersonate]] a typical worshipper of another faith or to [[Lie]] specifically to claim you are a member of the faith you are Impersonating.
	- You still need to use the Deception skill to Impersonate a specific worshipper or to perform other deceptive actions, such as attempting to Lie about any other matter.
