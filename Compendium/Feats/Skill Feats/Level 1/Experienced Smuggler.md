# Experienced Smuggler  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** You often smuggle things past the authorities.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Stealth]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When the GM rolls your [[Stealth]] check to see if a passive observer notices when you [[Conceal an Object]], your die roll has a minimum value. Any die roll less then 10 is increased to 10 before adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result.
	- If you’re a master in Stealth, the minimum die value increases to 15.
	- If you’re legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers.
- This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items.
