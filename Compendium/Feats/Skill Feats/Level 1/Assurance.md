# Assurance &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") [Fortune](Fortune.md "Effect Trait") 
**Description:** Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in at least one skill.

## Mechanical Rules

- When you take this feat, choose a skill you’re trained in. 
	- You can forgo rolling a skill check for that skill to instead receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses, penalties, or modifiers).
- **Special:** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different skill and gain the benefits for that skill.
## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Fortune]] trait.
	- A fortune effect beneficially alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one fortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple fortune effects would apply, you have to pick which to use. 
	- A misfortune effect detrimentally alters how you roll your dice. You can never have more than one misfortune effect alter a single roll. If multiple misfortune effects would apply, the GM decides which is worse and applies it.
	- If a fortune effect and a mis effect would apply to the same roll, the two cancel each other out, and you roll normally.
