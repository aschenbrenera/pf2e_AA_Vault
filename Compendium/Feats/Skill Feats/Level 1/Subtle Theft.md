# Subtle Theft &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You are better at taking items while avoiding detection.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Thievery]]

## Mechanical Rules

- When you successfully [[Steal]] something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a –2 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft.
- Additionally, if you first [[Create a Diversion]] using Deception, taking a single [[Palm an Object]] or Steal action doesn’t end your [[Undetected]] condition.
