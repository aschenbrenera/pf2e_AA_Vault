# Terrain Stalker  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** Your ability to stealth is improved in a particular terrain.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Stealth]]

## Mechanical Rules

- Select one type of difficult terrain from the following list: rubble, snow, or underbrush.
- While undetected by all non-allies in that type of terrain, you can Sneak without attempting a Stealth check as long as you move no more than 5 feet and do not pass within 10 feet of an enemy during your movement.  
- During exploration, this also allows you to automatically approach within 15 feet of other creatures while Avoiding their Notice, as long as they aren’t actively Searching or on guard.  
- **Special:** You can select this feat multiple times. Each time, choose a different type of terrain.
