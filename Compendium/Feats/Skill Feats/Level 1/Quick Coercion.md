# Hobnobber &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You can bully others with just a few choice implications.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Intimidation]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You can [[Coerce]] a creature after 1 round of conversation instead of 1 minute.
- You still can’t Coerce a creature in the midst of combat, or without engaging in a conversation.

> [!tip] Tabletop Interpretation
> This appears to be feat tax for what should essentially be base game functionality.  Alternate rules are given under Coerce that fold this feat into the action itself.
