# Experienced Professional &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. 

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Lore]].

## Mechanical Rules

- When you use [[Lore]] to [[Earn Income]], if you roll a critical failure, you instead get a failure. 
- If youâ€™re an expert in Lore, you gain twice as much income from a failed check to Earn Income, unless it was originally a critical failure.
