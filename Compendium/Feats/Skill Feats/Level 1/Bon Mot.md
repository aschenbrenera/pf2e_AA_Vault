# Bon Mot [](#Actions "Single Action") &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait")  [Auditory](Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Emotion](Emotion.md "Effect Trait") [Linguistic](Linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](Mental.md "Effect Trait") 
**Description:** You launch an insightful quip at a foe, distracting them.

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Diplomacy]].
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- Choose a foe within 30 feet and roll a Diplomacy check against the target's Will DC.

> [!success-degree]
>- **Critical Success:** The target is distracted and takes a –3 status penalty to Perception and Will saves for 1 minute. 
>	- The target can end the effect early with a retort to your Bon Mot. This can either be a single action that has the `Concentrate` trait or an appropriate skill action to frame their retort. The GM determines which skill actions qualify, though they must take at least 1 action. Typically, the retort needs to use a linguistic Charisma-based skill action. 
>- **Success:** As critical success, but the penalty is –2.  
>- **Critical Failure:** Your quip is atrocious. You take the same penalty an enemy would take had you succeeded. This ends after 1 minute or if you issue another Bon Mot and succeed.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Linguistic]] trait.
	- A linguistic effect that targets a creature works only if the target understands the language you are using.
