# Survey Wildlife  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[Exploration](Exploration.md "Action & Ability Trait") [General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** You can study details in the wilderness to determine the presence of nearby creatures. 

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Survival]].
**Activity:** Exploration

## Mechanical Rules

- You can spend 10 minutes assessing the area around you to find out what creatures are nearby, based on nests, scat, and marks on vegetation.
- Attempt a Survival check against a DC determined by the GM based on how obvious the signs are. 
  > [!success-degree]
  > - **Success:** You can attempt a [[Recall Knowledge]] check with a –2 penalty to learn more about the creatures just from these signs. If you’re a master in Survival, you don’t take the penalty.
