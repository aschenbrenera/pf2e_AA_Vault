# Forager  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** You are well-suited at subsisting off the land.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Survival]]

## Mechanical Rules

- While using Survival to [[Subsist]], if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success.
- On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures
- On a critical success, you can take care of twice as many additional creatures than a success.
- You can choose to support half the number of creatures with a comfortable living.  
- Increase the number of additional creatures you feed on a success to eight if you’re an expert in Survival, 16 if you’re a master, and 32 if you’re legendary.
