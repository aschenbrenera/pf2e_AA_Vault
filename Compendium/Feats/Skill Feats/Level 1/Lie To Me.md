# Lie To Me &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You can use Deception to weave traps to trip up anyone trying to deceive you. 

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Deception]]

## Mechanical Rules

- If you can engage in conversation with someone trying to [[Lie]] to you, use your Deception DC if it is higher than your Perception DC to determine whether they succeed.
- This doesn’t apply if you don’t have a back-and-forth dialogue, such as when someone attempts to Lie during a long speech.
