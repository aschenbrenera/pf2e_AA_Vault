# Experienced Tracker &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** Tracking is second nature to you, and when necessary you can follow a trail without pause.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Survival]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You can [[Track]] while moving at full Speed by taking a –5 penalty to your [[Survival]] check.
	- If you’re a master in Survival, you don’t take the –5 penalty.
	- If you’re legendary in Survival, you no longer need to roll a new Survival check every hour when tracking, though you still need to roll whenever there are significant changes in the trail.

## Leads to

- [[Swift Tracker]]
