# Schooled in Secrets &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You notice the signs and symbols that members of mystery cults and other secret societies use to declare their affiliation to fellow members.

**Prerequisites:**Â Trained in [[Occultism]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use Occultism in place of Diplomacy to [[Gather Information]] about mystery cults and other secret societies.
- You can use Occultism in place of Deception to [[Impersonate]] a member of mystery cults and other secret societies.
- If you belong to a secret cult, lodge, sect, or similar organization, you automatically recognize members of your group unless they are specifically attempting to conceal their presence from you. They also recognize your standing unless you are specifically concealing it.
