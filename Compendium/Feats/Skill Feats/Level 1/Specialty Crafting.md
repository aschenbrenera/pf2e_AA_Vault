# Specialty Crafting &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item.
**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Crafting]].

## Mechanical Rules

-  Select one of the specialties listed below. 
	- You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Craft items of that type.
	- If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to +2.
	- If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.
