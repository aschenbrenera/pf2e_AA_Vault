# Natural Medicine  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** You can apply natural cures to heal your allies.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Nature]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You can use Nature instead of Medicine to [[Treat Wounds]], including higher Nature proficiency letting you attempt more difficult checks.
- If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to Treat Wounds using Nature, subject to the GM’s determination.
- This feat doesn’t replace Medicine for uses of the skill other than Treat Wounds or for feat prerequisites.
