# Quick Identification &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You can Identify Magic swiftly.

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Arcana]], [[Nature]], [[Occultism]], or [[Religion]].

## Mechanical Rules

- You take only 1 minute when using [[Identify Magic]] to determine the properties of an item, ongoing effect, or location, rather than 10 minutes.
	- If you’re a master in the relevant skill, it takes a 3-action activity
	- If you’re a legendary in the relevant skill, it takes 1 action.
