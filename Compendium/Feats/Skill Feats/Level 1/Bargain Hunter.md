# Bargain Hunter &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You can spend your days hunting for bargains and reselling at a profit. You can also spend time specifically sniffing out a great bargain on an item.

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Diplomacy]].

## Mechanical Rules

- You can [[Earn Income]] using [[Diplomacy]].
	- Instead of gaining money, you can instead purchase an item at a discount equal to the money you would have gained, gaining the item for free if your earned income equals or exceeds its cost. 
- Finally, if you select Bargain Hunter during character creation at 1st level, you start play with an additional 2 gp.
