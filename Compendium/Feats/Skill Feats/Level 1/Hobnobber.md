# Hobnobber &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") 
**Description:** You are skilled at learning information through conversation.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Diplomacy]]

## Mechanical Rules

-  The [[Gather Information]] exploration activity takes you half as long as normal (typically reducing the time to 1 hour). 
- If you’re a master in Diplomacy and roll a critical failure to Gather Information, you get a failure instead. There is still no guarantee that a rumor you learn with Gather Information is accurate.
