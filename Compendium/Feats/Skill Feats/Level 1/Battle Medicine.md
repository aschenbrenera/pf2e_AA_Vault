# Battle Medicine [](#Actions "Single Action") &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[General](General.md "Feat Trait") [Skill](Skill.md "Feat Trait") [Healing](Healing.md "Effect Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait")
**Description:** You can patch up wounds, even in combat.

**Prerequisite:** Trained in [[Medicine]].
**Requirements:** You're holding or wearing a [[Healer's Toolkit]].
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- The target is immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day. This does not make them immune to, or otherwise count as, Treat Wounds.
- Attempt a Medicine check with the same DC as for [[Treat Wounds]] and restore the corresponding amount of HP.
	- This doesn’t remove the wounded condition.
	- As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank.
