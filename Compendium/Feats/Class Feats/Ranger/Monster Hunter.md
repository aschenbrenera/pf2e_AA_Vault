# Monster Hunter  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[Ranger](Ranger.md "Class Trait")
**Description:** You quickly assess your prey and apply what you know.

## Mechanical Rules

-  As part of the action used to [[Hunt Prey]], you can attempt a check to [[Recall Knowledge]] about your prey.
	- When you critically succeed to [[Identify Creature|identify]] your hunted prey with that check, you note a weakness in the creatureâ€™s defenses in addition to any other benefits. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack roll against that prey, and any ally you tell gains the same benefit.
	- You can give bonuses from Monster Hunter only once per day against a particular creature.

## Gameplay Tips

- To make this ability work as intended, a ranger should be considered to have successfully identified a creature when they succeed a Recall Knowledge check, regardless of what information they gain.
