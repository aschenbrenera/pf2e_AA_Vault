# Reach Spell [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Spellshape](Spellshape.md "Feat Trait")
**Description:** You can extend your spells’ range.

**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- If the next action you use is to Cast a Spell that has a range, increase that spell’s range by 30 feet.
	- As is standard for increasing spell ranges, if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend its range to 30 feet.
