# Trap Finder  &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

**Description:** You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the presence of traps.

## Mechanical Rules

- You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps.
- Even if you aren’t Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.  
- You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in Thievery. 
	- If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead, and your circumstance bonuses against traps increase to +2.
