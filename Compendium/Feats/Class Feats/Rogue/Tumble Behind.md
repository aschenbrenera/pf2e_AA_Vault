# Tumble Behind &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[Rogue](Rules/Traits/Class/Rogue.md "Class Trait")
**Description:** You tumble under and behind your foe, your rapid movement letting you catch them off guard.

## Mechanical Rules

- When you successfully [[Tumble Through]], the foe whose space you passed through is [[Off-Guard]] against the next attack you make before the end of your turn.
