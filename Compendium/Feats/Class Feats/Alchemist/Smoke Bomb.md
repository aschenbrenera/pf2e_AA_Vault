# Smoke Bomb  &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[Alchemist](Alchemist.md "Class Trait") [Additive](Additive.md "Effect Trait") 
**Description:** You can add a tarry additive to an alchemical bomb to make it emit smoke.


## Mechanical Rules

- You can modify an alchemical bomb.
- When thrown, in addition to its normal effects, the bomb creates a cloud of smoke in a 10-foot burst.
	- You choose which corner of the target's space (or the space in which the bomb lands) the cloud is centered on.
	- Creatures within that area have the [[Concealed]] condition, and all other creatures are concealed to them.
	- The smoke lasts for 1 minute or until dissipated by a strong wind.
