# Snagging Strike [](#Actions "Single Action") &emsp;*(Feat 1)*

[DH_Fighter](DH_Fighter.md "Class Trait")
**Description:** You combine an attack with quick grappling moves to throw an enemy off balance as long as it stays in your reach.

**Requirements:** You have one hand free, and your target is within reach of that hand.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- Make a Strike while keeping one hand free. If this Strike hits, the target is [[Off-Guard]] until the start of your next turn or until it’s no longer within the reach of your hand, whichever comes first.
