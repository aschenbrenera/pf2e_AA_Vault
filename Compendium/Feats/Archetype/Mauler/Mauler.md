# Mauler Dedication &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[Archetype](Archetype.md "Feat Trait") [Dedication](Dedication.md "Feat Trait") [Mauler](Mauler.md "Class Trait")

**Prerequisites:** Strength +2
**Description:** You specialize in melee weapons that require two hands. 

## Mechanical Rules

- You have familiarity with all melee weapons that require two hands to wield or have the two-hand trait. For the purposes of proficiency, you treat any of these that are martial weapons as simple weapons and any that are advanced weapons as martial weapons.
- If you are at least an expert in such a weapon, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with that weapon.
