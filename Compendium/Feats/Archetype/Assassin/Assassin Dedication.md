# Assassin Dedication  &emsp;*(Feat 2)*

[Archetype](Archetype.md "Feat Trait") [Dedication](Dedication.md "Feat Trait") [Assassin](Assassin.md "Class Trait")
**Description:** You've trained to assassinate your foes, and you do so with tenacity and precision.

**Prerequisites:** Trained in [[Deception]] and [[Stealth]]

## Mechanical Rules

- You gain the [[Mark for Death]] activity.
- In addition, when attacking your mark, you have the [[Sneak Attack]] class feature, except it deals 1d4 precision damage and you don't increase the number of dice as you gain levels.
	- At 6th level, the damage increases to 1d6.
	- If you already have the sneak attack class feature, you instead deal an additional 1 precision damage with your sneak attacks made against your mark, increasing to 2 precision damage at 6th level.
