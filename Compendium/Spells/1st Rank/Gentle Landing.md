# Gentle Landing [](#Actions "Reaction") &emsp;*(Spell 1)*

[Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Air](Air.md "Effect Trait") 
**Description:** You raise a magical updraft to arrest a fall.

**Traditions:** arcane, primal 

**Trigger:** A creature within range is falling
**Range:** 60 feet
**Targets:** 1 falling creature
**Duration:** 1 minute
**Activity:** Reaction ⤾

## Mechanical Rules

- The target's fall slows to 60 feet per round, and the portion of the fall during the spell's duration doesn't count when calculating [[Falling|Falling Damage]]. If the target reaches the ground while the spell is in effect, it takes no damage from the fall. The spell ends as soon as the target lands.
