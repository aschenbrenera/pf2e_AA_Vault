# Illusory Object [](#Actions "Two-Action") &emsp;*(Spell 1)*

[Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait") [Illusion](Illusion.md "Effect Trait") [Visual](Visual.md "Effect Trait")
**Description:** You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object.

**Traditions:** arcane, occult

**Range:** 500 feet
**Area:** 20-foot burst
**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Activity:** Two Action ⬥⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You create an illusory visual image of a stationary object.
	- The entire image must fit within the spell's area.
	- The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. For example, water would appear to pour down an illusory waterfall, but it would be silent.  
- Any creature that touches the image or uses the [[Seek]] action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.

> [!info] Heighten
>- **Heightened (2nd):** Your image makes appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the `Auditory`  and `Olfactory` traits. The duration increases to 1 hour.
>- **Heightened (5th):** As the 2nd-rank version, but the duration is unlimited.


## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Illusion]] trait.
	- If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. 
	- To attempt to disbelieve an illusion, a creature must intentionally engage with it, typically using: **Seek**, **Interact**, or another meaningful action chosen by the GM.
		- The action triggers a check—usually Perception vs. the caster’s Spell DC. For some mental illusions, the spell might specify a Will save instead.
		- On success, ignore all of the illusion's effects. Even after disbelieving, illusions may still impose concealment effects, at the GM’s discretion.
