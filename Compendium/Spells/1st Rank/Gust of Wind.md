## Mechanical Rules

- The wind blows from the point where you are when you Cast the Spell to the line's opposite end.
- The wind extinguishes small non-magical fires, disperses fog and mist, blows objects of light Bulk or less around, and pushes larger objects.
- Large or smaller creatures in the area must attempt a Fortitude save. Large or smaller creatures that later move into the gust must attempt the save on entering.
