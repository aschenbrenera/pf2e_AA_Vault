# Heal [](#Actions "Single Action") To [](#Actions "Three-Action") &emsp;*(Spell 1)*

[Healing](Healing.md "Effect Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait") [Vitality](Vitality.md "Effect Trait") 
**Description:** You channel vital energy to heal the living or damage the undead.

**Traditions:** divine, primal

**Range:** Varies
**Targets:** 1 willing living creature or 1 undead creature
**Activity:** One to Three Actions ⬥ - ⬥⬥⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- If the target is a willing living creature, you restore 1d8 Hit Points.
- If the target is undead, you deal that amount of vitality damage to it, and it gets a [[Basic Saving Throw|Basic]] Fortitude save.
- The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters (mutually exclusive effects).
	- One-action (⬥) The spell has a range of touch.  
	- Two-actions (⬥⬥) (`Concentrate`) The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're healing a living creature, increase the Hit Points restored by 8.  
	- Three-actions (⬥⬥⬥) (`Concentrate`) You disperse vital energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

>- **Heightened (+1):** The amount of healing or damage increases by 1d8, and the extra healing for the 2-action version increases by 8.
