## Mechanical Rules

- You fire a shard of solidified magic toward a creature that you can see.
- For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, increase the number of shards you shoot by one, to a maximum of three shards for 3 actions. You choose the target for each shard individually. 
	- If you shoot more than one shard at the same target, combine the damage before applying bonuses or penalties to damage, resistances, weaknesses, and so forth.
- Shards automatically hit and deal 1d4+1 force damage.
