## Mechanical Rules

-  A creature that falls [[Unconscious]] from this spell doesn't fall prone or release what it's holding.
- This spell doesn't prevent creatures from waking up due to a successful Perception check, limiting its utility in combat.  

> [!success-degree]
> **Critical Success** The creature is unaffected. 
> **Success** The creature takes a –1 status penalty to Perception checks for 1 round. 
> **Failure** The creature falls unconscious. If it's still unconscious after 1 minute, it wakes up automatically.  
> **Critical Failure** The creature falls unconscious. If it's still unconscious after 1 hour, it wakes up automatically.

> [!info] Heighten
>- **Heightened (4th):** The creatures fall unconscious for 1 round on a failure or 1 minute on a critical failure. They fall [[Prone]] and release what they're holding, and they can't attempt Perception checks to wake up. When the duration ends, the creature is sleeping normally instead of automatically waking up.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Follows the rules for the [[Incapacitation]] trait.
	- If the incapacitation trait is on a spell, a creature with a level of more than twice the spell's  effective rank gains the listed benefit against the spell (Heightened Spells increase a spell's effective rank).
	- **Benefit:** Creatures with this benefit treat the result of their check to prevent being incapacitated as one degree of success better or the result of any check the spellcaster made to incapacitate them as one degree of success worse.
- A creature wakes up from this spell if any of the following occur:
	- The listed duration ends.
	- It takes damage, though if the damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it remains unconscious and gains the dying condition as normal.
	- It receives healing, other than the natural healing received from resting.
	- Someone shakes it awake with an Interact action.
	- At the start of it's turn, it automatically attempts a Perception check against a noise DC (see unconscious) set by GM, waking up if it succeeds. If creatures are attempting to stay quiet around you, this Perception check is against their Stealth DCs.
