## Mechanical Rules

- Target a single creature. For each additional action you use when Casting the Spell, you can fire an additional ray at a different target, to a maximum of three rays targeting three different targets for 3 actions.  
- Make a spell attack roll for each of the targeted creatures.
	- On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage, and on a critical hit, the target takes double damage.  
	- If you spend 2 or more actions Casting the Spell, the damage increases to 4d6 fire damage on a hit, and it still deals double damage on a critical hit.
	- Each ray increases your multiple attack penalty, but you don't increase your multiple attack penalty until after you make all the spell attack rolls for blazing bolt.
