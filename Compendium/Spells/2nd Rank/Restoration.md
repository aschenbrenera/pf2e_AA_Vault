# Restoration  &emsp;*(Spell 2)*

[Healing](Healing.md "Effect Trait") [Necromancy](Necromancy.md "Effect Trait")
**Description:** Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best.

**Traditions:** divine, occult, primal 

**Range:** Touch
**Targets:** 1 creature
**Activity:** 1 minute

## Mechanical Rules

- When you cast _restoration_, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin.
	- **Lessen a Toxin:** Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.
	- **Reduce a Condition:** Reduce the value of the target's [[Clumsy]], [[Enfeebled]], or [[Stupefied]] condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.
- A creature can benefit from only one _restoration_ spell each day, and it can't benefit from _restoration_ more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.

>- **Heightened (4th):** Add [[Drained]] to the list of conditions you can reduce. When you lessen a toxin, reduce the stage by two. You also gain a third option that allows you to reduce the target's [[Doomed]] value by 1. You can't use this to reduce a permanent doomed condition.
>- **Heightened (6th):** As the 4th-level _restoration_, but you can reduce a permanent Doomed condition if you add a spellcasting action and a material component while Casting the Spell, during which you provide 100 gp worth of diamond dust as a cost.
