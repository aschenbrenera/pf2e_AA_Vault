## Mechanical Rules

- You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and [[Dim light]] for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose.
- If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves.
- You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement.  
- You can Dismiss the spell.
- If you Cast the Spell while you already have four _light_ spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.
