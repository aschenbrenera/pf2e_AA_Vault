# Message [](#Actions "Single Action") &emsp;*(Cantrip 1)*

[Cantrip](Cantrip.md "General Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Auditory](Auditory.md "Effect Trait") [Illusion](Illusion.md "Effect Trait") [Linguistic](Linguistic.md "Effect Trait") [Mental](Mental.md "Effect Trait") [Subtle](Subtle.md "General Trait")
**Description:** You mouth words quietly, but instead of coming out of your mouth, they're transferred directly to the ears of the target.

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult

**Range:** 120 feet
**Targets:** 1 creature
**Duration:** Until the end of target creatures turn.
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- While others can't hear your words any better than if you normally mouthed them, the target can hear your words as if they were standing next to you.
- The target can give a brief response as a reaction, or as a free action on their next turn if they wish, but they must be able to see you and be within range to do so.
	- If they respond, their response is delivered directly to your ear, just like the original message.

> [!info] Heighten
>- **Heightened (3rd):** The spell's range increases to 500 feet.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
- Follows the rules for the [[Subtle]] trait.
	- A spell with the subtle trait can be cast without incantations and doesn't have obvious manifestations.
- Follows the rules for the [[Illusion]] trait.
	- If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. 
	- To attempt to disbelieve an illusion, a creature must intentionally engage with it, typically using: **Seek**, **Interact**, or another meaningful action chosen by the GM.
		- The action triggers a check—usually Perception vs. the caster’s Spell DC. For some mental illusions, the spell might specify a Will save instead.
		- On success, ignore all of the illusion's effects. Even after disbelieving, illusions may still impose concealment effects, at the GM’s discretion.
