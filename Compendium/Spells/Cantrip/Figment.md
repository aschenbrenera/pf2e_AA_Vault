# Figment [](#Actions "Two-Action") &emsp;*(Cantrip 1)*

[Cantrip](Cantrip.md "General Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Illusion](Illusion.md "Effect Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait") [Subtle](Subtle.md "General Trait")
**Description:** You create a simple illusory sound or vision.

**Traditions:** arcane, occult
**Bloodline:** fey

**Range:** 30 feet
**Duration:** Sustained
**Defense:** [[Basic Saving Throw|Basic]] Reflex
**Activity:** Two Action ⬥⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- Create the illusion of a sound or vision.
	- A sound adds the `Auditory` trait to the spell and the sound can't include intelligible words or elaborate music. 
	- A vision adds the `Visual` trait, can be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and is clearly crude and undetailed if viewed from within 15 feet.
- When you Cast or Sustain the Spell, you can attempt to [[Create a Diversion]] with the illusion, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to your [[Deception]] check. If the attempt fails against a creature, that creature disbelieves the figment.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
- Follows the rules for the [[Subtle]] trait.
	- A spell with the subtle trait can be cast without incantations and doesn't have obvious manifestations.
- Follows the rules for the [[Illusion]] trait.
	- If the illusion is visual, and a creature interacts with the illusion in a way that would prove it is not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can’t ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. 
	- To attempt to disbelieve an illusion, a creature must intentionally engage with it, typically using: **Seek**, **Interact**, or another meaningful action chosen by the GM.
		- The action triggers a check—usually Perception vs. the caster’s Spell DC. For some mental illusions, the spell might specify a Will save instead.
		- On success, ignore all of the illusion's effects. Even after disbelieving, illusions may still impose concealment effects, at the GM’s discretion.
