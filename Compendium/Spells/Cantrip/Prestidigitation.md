# # Prestidigitation [](#Actions "Two-Action") &emsp;*(Cantrip 1)*

[Cantrip](Cantrip.md "General Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait") 
**Description:** The simplest magic does your bidding.

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult, primal
**Bloodline:** imperial

**Range:** 10 feet
**Targets:**  1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
**Duration:** Sustained
**Activity:** Two Action ⬥⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the spell. Each time you Sustain the spell, you can choose one of four options.
	- **Cook:** Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
	- **Lift:** Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
	- **Make:** Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile—it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or locus or cost for a spell.
	- **Tidy:** Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.
- _Prestidigitation_ can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the spell.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
