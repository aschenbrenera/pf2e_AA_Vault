## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
- Follows the rules for the [[Morph]] trait.
	- Any Strikes specifically granted by a morph effect are magical.
	- You can be affected by multiple morph spells at once, but if you morph the same body part more than once, the second morph effect attempts to Counteract the first. The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.
		- Your Morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect.
