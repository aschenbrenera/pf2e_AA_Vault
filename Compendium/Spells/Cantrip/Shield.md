# Shield [](#Actions "Single Action") &emsp;*(Cantrip 1)*

[Cantrip](Cantrip.md "General Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Force](Force.md "Effect Trait")
**Description:** You raise a magical shield of force.

**Traditions:** arcane, divine, occult
**Bloodlines:** draconic
**Mystery:** battle

**Duration:** Until the start of your next turn
**Activity:** Single Action ⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- This counts as using the [[Raise a Shield]] action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use.
- While the spell is in effect, you can use the [[Shield Block]] reaction with your magic shield. The shield has Hardness 5.
	- You can use the spell's reaction to reduce damage from any spell or magical effect, even if it doesn't deal physical damage.
	- After you use Shield Block, the spell ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes.

> [!info] Heighten
>- **Heightened (+2):** The shield's Hardness increases by 5.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
