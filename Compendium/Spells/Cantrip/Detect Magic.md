# Detect Magic [](#Actions "Two-Action") &emsp;*(Cantrip 1)*

[Cantrip](Cantrip.md "General Trait") [Concentrate](Concentrate.md "Action & Ability Trait") [Detection](Detection.md "Effect Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "General Trait") 
**Description:** You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. 

**Traditions**: arcane, divine, occult, primal
**Bloodline**: imperial

**Area:** 30-foot emanation
**Activity:** Two Action ⬥⬥

## Mechanical Rules

- You receive no information beyond the presence or absence of magic.
- You can choose to ignore magic you're fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.  
- You detect `Illusion` magic only if that magic's effect has a lower rank than the rank of your _detect magic_ spell.
	- However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

> [!info] Heighten
>- **Heightened (3rd):** You learn the rank or level of the most powerful magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.
>- **Heightened (4th):** You also pinpoint the source of the highest-rank magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

## Gameplay Interaction

- Cantrip spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up.
