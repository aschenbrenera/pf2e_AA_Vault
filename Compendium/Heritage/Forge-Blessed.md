# Forge-Blessed

[Dwarf](Dwarf.md "Ancestry & Heritage Trait") `Legacy`
**Description:** You are from a family in Highhelm that venerates a particular dwarven deity above all others. Your birth was blessed by your family's patron deity, granting you a fraction of their power. 

**Prerequisite:** Dwarf

## Mechanical Rules

- Choose one deity from theÂ [dwarven pantheon](https://2e.aonprd.com/DeityCategories.aspx?ID=6). You can cast the 1st-level spell they grant clerics as an [[Innate Spell|Innate]] divine spell once per week.
