# Quick Alchemy [](#Actions "Single Action")

[Alchemist](Alchemist.md "Class Trait") [Manipulate](Manipulate.md "Action & Ability Trait")
**Description:** You can either use up a versatile vial to make another alchemical consumable at a moment's notice or create an especially short-lived versatile vial.
**Requirements** You're either holding or wearing an alchemist's toolkit and you have a free hand.

## Mechanical Rules

-  Any effect created by an item made with Quick Alchemy that would have a duration longer than 10 minutes lasts for 10 minutes instead. Choose one of the following:
- **Create Consumable:** You expend one of your versatile vials to create a single alchemical consumable item of your level or lower that's in your formula book.
	- You don't have to spend the normal monetary cost in alchemical raw materials or need to attempt a Crafting check.
	- This item has the [[Infused]] trait, but it remains potent only until the start of your next turn.
- **Quick Vial:** You create a [[Versatile Vial]] that can be used only as a bomb or for the versatile vial option from your research field (it can't be used to create a consumable, for example).
	- This item has the Infused trait, but it remains potent only until the end of your current turn.
