# Chirurgeon

[Alchemist](Alchemist.md "Class Trait")
**Source:** [[Research Field]]
**Description:** You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.

## Mechanical Rules

- **Formulas:** Two common 1st-level [alchemical elixirs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?Category=6&Subcategory=8) with the `Healing` trait.
- **Field Benefit:** You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites) and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks.
- **Field Vials:** Your versatile vials can be used to heal a living creature a number of Hit Points equal to the vial’s initial damage. A creature can drink the vial for this benefit, or you can throw the vial at a willing creature within 20 feet as an Interact action to heal that creature. In either case, a vial used this way loses the `Acid` and `Splash` traits and gains the [[Coagulant]] and `Healing` traits, plus the `Elixir` trait if a creature drinks it.
- **Field Discovery 5th:** Your medicinal elixirs are quite fortifying. When a creature drinks an Infused elixir with the healing trait that you have created, that creature gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0); these temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.
- **Advanced Vials 11th:** When you use a field vial to heal a creature that has half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, the `Coagulant` trait doesn’t apply to that healing.
- **Greater Field Discovery 13th:** When you use Quick Alchemy to create any type of elixir of life, the creature healed by the item regains the maximum Hit Points possible, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.

## Gameplay Tips

- At GM discretion, you may also allow your Field Benefit to include having your Alchemist's Toolkit fulfill any requirement that otherwise requires a Healer's Toolkit.
