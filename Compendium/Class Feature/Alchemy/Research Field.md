# Research Field

[Alchemist](Alchemist.md "General Trait")
 **Description:** Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. You might have a degree from a scientific institute, correspond with other researchers in your field, or work as a genius loner. 
  


## Mechanical Rules

 - At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up. 
	 - Research fields can be found [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/ResearchFields.aspx).

### Research Field Format

**Formulas** Add these formulas to your formula book at 1st level, in addition to your other formulas.  
**Field Benefit** Your studies and experiments taught you a specific technique, which varies widely from one field to another.  
**Field Vials** This ability modifies how you can use versatile vials.  
**Field Discovery, Advanced Vials, Greater Field Discovery** The remaining entries list your field's benefits for class features you gain at higher levels, including the level at which you typically gain them in parentheses.
