# Alchemy

[Alchemist](Alchemist.md "General Trait")
 **Description:** You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.

## Mechanical Rules

-    You gain the [[Alchemical Crafting]] feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for.
- You start with a standard [[Formula book]] for free.
	- The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to the formulas you gained from Alchemical Crafting and your research field.  
	- Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create.
	- Having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas.
- During your daily preparations, You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier.
	- Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait.
	- These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.
	- You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements. 
- During your daily preparations, you create a number of [[Versatile Vial]]s up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials.
	- If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.  
	- Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations.
	- A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft.
	- You can store all your versatile vials within your alchemist's toolkit, with no increase to its Bulk.
- You gain the [[Quick Alchemy]] action to make the items you need on the fly.

### Formula Book

An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. It's possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the [[Inventor]] skill feat so you can invent them.  

Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life.

### Advanced Alchemy

 Every day you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day. 

### Versatile Vials

You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. You can also use vials for Quick Alchemy and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial. 

Your versatile vials can be thrown like bombs.
