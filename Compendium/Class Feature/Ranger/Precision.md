# Precision

[Ranger](Ranger.md "Class Trait")
**Source:** [[Hunter's Edge]]
**Description:** You have trained to aim for your prey’s weak points. 

## Mechanical Rules

- The first time you hit your hunted prey in a round, you also deal 1d8 additional [[Precision Damage]]. 
	- Precision damage increases the damage you already deal, using the same type, but is ineffective against creatures that lack vital organs or weak points.
	- At 11th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8 precision damage, and at 19th level, the extra damage increases to 3d8 precision damage.
- At Ranger level 17 you gain the 'Master Hunter Upgrade'. 
	- The second time in a round you hit your hunted prey, you also deal 1d8 precision damage. At 19th level, your second hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 2d8 precision damage, and your third hit in a round against your hunted prey deals 1d8 precision damage.

## Gameplay Interaction

- Precision Damage is the accurate targeting of a vulnerable spot.
	- You increase the attack's listed damage, using the same damage type, rather than tracking a separate pool of damage.
	- Some creatures are immune to precision damage, regardless of the damage type; these are often amorphous creatures that lack vulnerable anatomy.
	- Since precision damage is always the same type of damage as the attack it's augmenting, a creature that is resistant to physical damage, like a gargoyle, would resist not only the dagger's damage but also the precision damage, even though it is not specifically resistant to precision damage.
