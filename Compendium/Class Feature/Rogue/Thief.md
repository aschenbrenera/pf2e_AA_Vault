# Thief

[Rogue](Rogue.md "Class Trait")
**Source:** [[Rogue's Racket]]

Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else, especially if you can do so completely unnoticed. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows, or even a consultant, testing clients’ vaults for openings.  When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. 

When you attack with a [[Finesse]] melee weapon or finesse melee unarmed attack, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.  
  
You are trained in [[Thievery]].
