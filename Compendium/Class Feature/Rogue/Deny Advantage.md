# Deny Advantage

[Rogue](Rules/Traits/Class/Rogue.md "Class Trait")
**Description:** As someone who takes advantage of openings, you are careful not to leave such gaps yourself.

## Mechanical Rules

- You aren't Off-Guard to Hidden, Undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.
