# Mastermind

[Rogue](Rogue.md "Class Trait")
**Source:** [[Rogue's Racket]]

You rely on your intellect to craft intricate schemes, planning 10 steps ahead where others might plan three. You might be a driven detective, a spymaster in the service of a powerful house, or an aspiring crime lord or information broker.  
  
If you successfully identify a creature using [[Recall Knowledge]] that creature is [[Off-Guard]] against your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's off-guard against your attacks for 1 minute.  
	Note: For the purposes of abilities like the mastermind rogue racket, a character is considered to have successfully identified a creature when they succeed or critically succeed at a Recall Knowledge check, regardless of what information they gain.
  
You're trained in [[Society]] and one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. You can choose Intelligence as your key attribute.
