# Cause

[Champion](Champion.md "Class Trait")

You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity’s name. Some causes are limited to certain sanctifications. Your cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special protective reaction called your champion’s reaction.

Choose a Cause: [[Justice]], [Liberation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Causes.aspx?ID=12), [Obedience](https://2e.aonprd.com/Causes.aspx?ID=13), [Grandeur (Holy)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Causes.aspx?ID=9), [Redemption (Holy)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Causes.aspx?ID=14), [Desecration (Unholy)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Causes.aspx?ID=8), [Iniquity (Unholy)](https://2e.aonprd.com/Causes.aspx?ID=10)

**Champion's Reaction:** You gain this reaction to enemy attacks.  
**Relentless Reaction:** If you gain the relentless reaction class feature (typically at 9th level), you add this benefit to your reaction. Damage dealt by your relentless reaction gains any holy or unholy trait you have.  
**Exalted Reaction** If you gain the exalted reaction class feature (typically at 11th level), when you use your champion's reaction you also give a benefit for your allies or detriment for your enemies.
