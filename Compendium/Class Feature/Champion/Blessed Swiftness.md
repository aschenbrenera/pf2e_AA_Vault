# Blessed Swiftness

## Mechanical Rules

- You gain a +5-foot status bonus to Speed.
	- If you're mounted, your mount gains the bonus instead.
- In addition, when the movement of one of your allies triggers an enemy's reaction while the ally is in your champion's aura, the ally gains a +2 status bonus to all defenses against that reaction.
