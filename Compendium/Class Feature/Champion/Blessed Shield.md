# Blessed Shield

## Mechanical Rules
 
 - In your hands, a shield gains the minor [_reinforcing_](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2811) rune.
	 - As you go up in level, the shield gains the _reinforcing_ rune of your level (lesser at 7th level, moderate at 10th level, greater at 13th level, major at 16th level, and supreme at 19th level).
	 - If your shield already has the appropriate _reinforcing_ rune for your level, or if it's a [sturdy shield](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2828) of the same level as the appropriate _reinforcing_ rune, the shield's Hardness instead increases by 1.
