# Blessed Armament

## Mechanical Rules

- Select one weapon or [handwraps of mighty blows](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3086).
	- You gain that armament's critical specialization effect.
	- You grant the armament a property rune of your choice from the following list:
		- [[Fearsome Rune]]
		- [ghost touch](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2840)
		- [returning](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2845)
		- [shifting](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2846)
		- [vitalizing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2852).
- During your daily preparations, you can change the spirit to inhabit a different armament, grant a different rune, or both.
