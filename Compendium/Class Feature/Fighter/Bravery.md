# Bravery

[DH_Fighter](DH_Fighter.md "Class Trait")
**Description:** Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear. 

## Mechanical Rules

- Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.
- When you roll a success at a Will save against a `Fear` effect, you get a critical success instead.
- In addition, anytime you gain the [[Frightened]] condition, reduce its value by 1.
