# Centipede Lore

Hunters and scavengers that live amid dung and detritus, centipedes are a relatively common and often reviled threat faced by adventurers. Scurrying about with surprising speed on the scores of legs attached to their long, segmented bodies, centipedes strike with poisoned mandibles to slow and torment their prey with a vicious toxin before they settle down to feed in slow and disgusting leisure.

Centipedes take nearly countless forms amid nearly every climate, with specific traits and abilities varying wildly between species. Tangled forests, arid deserts, foul sewers, deep caverns, and abandoned buildings are all common haunts for centipedes, from oversized specimens capable of taking down significant prey alone to carpets of frenzied vermin gathered into a dangerous swarm. Larger and more specialized centipedes than the two presented here exist, such as the sleek giant whiptail centipede or the immense titan centipede.
