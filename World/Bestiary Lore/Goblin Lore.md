# Goblin Lore

These small humanoids typically have green or gray skin and large heads with wide ears. While some goblins are civilized and have worked hard to be considered upstanding members of humanoid communities, many are impetuous and vicious creatures who delight in wreaking havoc. These goblins think nothing of slaughtering livestock, stealing, or burning down a building purely for momentary delight. They revel in playing malicious tricks on taller humanoids, whom they call “longshanks.”  
  
Goblins are superstitious, with an intense awe of magic and a fascination with fire; goblins who master magic or fire earn great respect from their kin. Most other humanoids find it difficult to understand goblins' outlook: they hate canines but eagerly share their lairs with so-called “goblin dogs,” they fearlessly attack larger creatures but are terrified of horses, and they despise vegetables yet consider pickles a delicacy. To a goblin, of course, these are all perfectly sensible life choices.

### Goblin Leadership

Goblins have many paths to leadership of their bands. Some inherit it, while others earn it by being the strongest, smartest, meanest, most charismatic, or even just plain luckiest. Surviving a fireball that wipes everyone else in a get gang out because they were busy eating a pickle is one way to know you have the goblin hero-gods' favor!

### Goblin Treasure

Although goblin warrens are generally filthy dumps, they sometimes contain actual treasures stolen from longshanks or other goblin tribes. Typical treasures include small pieces of jewelry, shiny items such as hand mirrors, and gold teeth. As they rarely trust each other, many goblins keep their most cherished baubles on their persons; these, might include useful weapons or minor magic items.

### Goblin Warrens

Goblins construct ramshackle warrens in forests and coastal regions, usually near the settlements of other humanoids for ease of scavenging and raiding.

### New Outlooks

It's a new era for goblins: while many still pose a threat, others venture out on their own, contributing in their own fashion to the greater good. Most such goblins still care little about the rules, but many are in fact kind at heart. Goblins most likely to be found living or adventuring among other ancestries include chefs, scavengers, and those found in _Monster Core_: commandos, pyros, war chanters, and warriors.

### The Goblin Song

The following ditty is perhaps the most infamous of goblin songs.  
  
_Goblins chew and goblins bite,  
Goblins cut and goblins fight.  
Stab the dog and cut the horse,  
Goblins eat and take by force!  
Goblins race and goblins jump.  
Goblins slash and goblins bump.  
Burn the skin and mash the head,  
Goblins here and you be dead!  
Chase the baby, catch the pup.  
Bonk the head to shut it up.  
Bones be cracked, flesh be stewed,  
We be goblins! You be food!_
