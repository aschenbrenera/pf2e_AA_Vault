# Animated Object Lore

Animated objects are mindless constructs. Granted a semblance of life through the use of rituals or other strange magic, animated objects take many forms and serve a variety of uses. 
- Many of these creatures serve as guardians, surprising unsuspecting adventurers when they suddenly attack.
- Others serve as idle distractions for the exceptionally rich, simple servants created to handle odd jobs, and the like.
- Most animated objects encountered by adventurers are permanently animated creatures, typically created by rituals.

[[Animated Broom]] (-1): Animated brooms perform menial tasks of cleaning and upkeep, but they can step in to defend a room from intrusion if needed. These simple animated objects can be found with greater frequency than more complicated and costly objects.

[[Animated Armor]] (2): Suits of animated armor see use both as guardians and as training partners in high-end martial academies able to afford the extravagance. Often, a warrior's old suit of armor can be turned into animated armor once it accrues too much battle damage to provide adequate protection. They're found most often in wizard laboratories and ancient dungeons.
