# Lands of the Linnorm Kings

**Continent:** Avistan
**Region:** Saga Lands
**Neighboring Lands:** Irrisen, New Thassilon, Realm of the Mammoth Lords, Varisia

The Lands of the Linnorm Kings are the homelands of the Ulfen people (vikings). Nestled on the northwestern tip of Avistan, it is a realm of forests and marshland that spends much of the year frozen beneath layers of snow, a place utterly inhospitable to all but the hardiest people.
