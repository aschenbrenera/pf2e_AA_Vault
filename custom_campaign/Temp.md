## 12. MASTER SUITE

When the players approach the master suite doors:

>[!info] Read Aloud
>Now atop the stairs, you find yourself before a pair of tall, grand double doors. Each door holds a dusty stained-glass window, their surfaces etched with intricate designs of  windmills—now dulled and obscured by age.
>
>The air seems colder here. Your breath fogs the glass. A hush falls over the house—no creaking, no groaning, only silence.
>
>And then, just beyond the glass, you see it: a silhouette, standing inches behind the doors. Still. Motionless. Dimly lit by a faint amber glow from somewhere within.

Pause here to allow the players to choose an action. If they observe, speak, cast a spell, or open the door, continue with:

> [!info] Read Aloud (if the players interact with the doors)
>As you focus on the figure, your heart begins to race. Though its form is formless—almost a shadow burned into the air—it slowly begins to **turn its head** toward you.
>
>A jolt of icy dread coils in your spine. Frost creeps into the corners of the glass panes as the temperature plummets.
>
>And then—just as suddenly—the silhouette **dissipates**, vanishing like smoke on the wind. The glow fades. The chill lifts. The sounds of the house return, as though nothing had ever been there at all.

Once the players open the doors:

> [!info] Read Aloud
> You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.
>
> A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.
>
> A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window.
>
> The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.
