> [!profile]+ **Profile: Durst Children Overview**
> - **Death:** Neglected by their parents and locked in their room until they starved to death.
> 	- The children know that they're dead. If asked how they died, Rose and Thorn explain that their parents locked them in the attic to protect them from "the monster in the basement," and that they died from hunger.
> 	- Their small skeletons lie in the middle of the floor, plain as day, wearing tattered clothing that the characters recognize as belonging to the children. Thorn's skeleton cradles the boy's stuffed doll.
> - **Emotions:**
> 	- The children don't like it when the characters disturb their toys.
> 	- The children fear abandonment. If one or more characters try to leave, the ghost-children attempt to possess them..
> - **Secrets:**
> 	- If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the doll house and says, "There's a secret door in the attic." Characters who then search the dollhouse for secret doors gain advantage on their Wisdom (Perception) checks to find them.
> 	- The dollhouse contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted molds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house. The dolls are made of painted resin. Any character looking inside the dollhouse while in Rose and Thorn’s room can see the appropriately-placed dolls of all living creatures within the manor. The dollhouse only contains rooms within the house itself, and does not depict the dungeon levels below.
> 	- Rose shyly shares her diary’s location, which can be found hidden in the cobweb-covered pillowcase on her bed. Rose’s aged and faded diary contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother, her nursemaid (“Miss Klara”), and arguments between her mother and father. (Rose doesn't know anything about the content of those fights.)
