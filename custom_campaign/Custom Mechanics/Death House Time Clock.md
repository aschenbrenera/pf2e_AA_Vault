# Death House Time Clock

**Description:**  When the clock strikes six, place six six-sided dice on the table in front of the players, with each side showing a six. As the players explore the house, tick this dice clock downward to indicate the passage of time, always starting with the die showing the lowest number. If the lowest die shows a one, you can tick it down to “zero” by removing it from the group instead.

## Mechanical Rules

- Each pip on the dice represents ten minutes.

The dice clock counts down as follows to represent the total time the players have spent in the house:

- Each time the players enter a new floor of the house or dungeon, tick the dice clock down by one.
- Each time the players search an entire room, tick the dice clock down by one.

A full hour passes each time a die is removed. The grandfather clock in the **Main Hall** sounds on the hour, every hour, and can be heard throughout the house and dungeon.

When the clock strikes midnight, the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** awakens and makes a beeline for the players, exiting through the **Hidden Trapdoor** into the **Den of Wolves** if necessary to reach them. At least one minute should pass between the time the mound wakes up and the time that it first reaches the players.
