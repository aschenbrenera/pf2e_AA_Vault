# Quick Intro

This is the rapid intro when you don't have much time to get into the story.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> Each of you, for your own reasons, has come to **Falcon’s Hollow** (Andoran), a rough-edged frontier town pressed against the treeline of **Darkmoon Vale**, a vast and brooding forest. Caravans pass through often, and trouble on the forest roads is common—yet lately, something strange has begun to stir.
>
> This morning, you were all summoned by **Deputy Magistrate Thalvaren**, who sought capable hands willing to take on dangerous work. Several travelers have gone missing in the past week. The only common thread is that each vanished after sunset while traveling the **Darkmoon Trade road**, shortly after a strange, thick, and unnatural mist appeared.
>
> The magistrate tasked you with investigating and provided instructions on how to reach the stretch of road where the disappearances have occurred. With daylight already fading, you set out at once.
> You leave Falcon’s Hollow behind and march down the Darkmoon Trade road. The forest looms closer. The journey gives each of you a moment to glance at your companions—some familiar, some strangers brought together by circumstance.

 Introduce yourselves.

> The sun is dipping behind the trees when you reach the stretch of road you were guided to.
> Moments later, you spot a rickety cart drawn by an old mule, rattling quickly toward you. A wide-eyed gnome stands in the back, urging the animal forward though it barely manages more than a brisk trot. As the cart nears, the Gnome yells at you, but doesn't slow down:
> "Turn back, the mists come with nightfall, and you don't want to be out there when that happens."

>[!warning] Conversation - Gnome
> - Why is the Mist Dangerous?:
> 	- “Folk who wander into it don’t come back the same—if they come back at all. Those who do… talk about a house that shouldn’t be there. A house only ever seen in the fog.”
> - What takes the people?:
> 	- "No one knows! But people occasionally hear screams and howls."
> - What do you know about the house?:
> 	- "To stay away. What else do you need to know. The whole business is unholy."
> - How can we find the house?:
> 	- “If you’re mad enough to try, just keep forward. The mist will find you. It always does.”

>[!info] Read Aloud
> Sunlight has nearly vanished now, and a sudden chill settles around you. It takes only a few minutes of walking before true darkness creeps across the forest. Moonlight filters weakly through the canopy, unable to cut the deepening gloom.
>
> Then—without warning—the **mist is simply there**. Thick. Soundless. All-consuming. You can’t recall the exact moment it surrounded you… only that the road beneath your feet is faded away.
>
> After pushing through the fog for what feels like minutes, shapes begin to form. A clearing opens ahead. Rising from the mist, stark and silent, stands a tall, shadowed structure.
