# Quick Intro

This is the rapid intro when you don't have much time to get into the story.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> Each of you, for your own reasons, has come to **Daggerford**, a small town on the edge of a vast forrest known for frequent caravans and trouble on the roads. 
> This morning, you were all summoned by _Lady Morwen’s guard_ based on your collective reputation for taking on odd jobs. The guard has asked you to investigate unsettling reports in the last week from a nearby merchant road of missing travelers. The only connection between the travelers is sightings of an usual mist and the proximity to the an abandoned old manor the local's fear. The guard's give you instructions on how to reach the merchant road, and tell you where the manor is.
