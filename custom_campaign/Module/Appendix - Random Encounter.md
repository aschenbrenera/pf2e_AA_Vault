# Random Encounters
- A player hears rats scrabbling up and down the spaces between the walls. A thick, choking stench of rot seeps into the room.
- A player hears the sound of a woman’s humming emanating from the opposite side of a closed door. If the door is cracked open, a cold blue eye stares back before vanishing.
- A player hears footsteps descending from the attic, which stop outside of their door before moving away to the library. Soon after, a grinding noise can be heard coming from the library—the sound of the secret door.
- A player hears maniacal laughter echoing from far below the house.
- A player hears a pleading female voice in their right ear that swears that “it isn’t his.” Another, colder female voice in the player’s left ear scoffs and says, "You would say that, you little _harlot_."
