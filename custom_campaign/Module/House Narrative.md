# Intro

After the characters complete [[Intro]], start the following.

# Arrival
>[!info] Read Aloud
> A grand manor stands before you. Four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor. It all forms a picture of chilling grandeur.
>
>Directly in front of you is the portico, a stone arch standing before the house's front doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch, its rusty hinges creak as it sways in the wind.
>
>On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.
>
>Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time.
>
>A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.

[[house_front.png]]
The characters who stay outside can see the mists closing in on them, leaving them only the refuge to go inside.

# Ground Floor

## Foyer
When players enter into Foyer
>[!info] Read Aloud
> You step into a dark Foyer. Hanging on the south wall is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of-arms, flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats. You see Mahogany-framed double doors set with panes of stained glass leading further into the house.

The coat of arms is a stylized golden windmill on a red field, the portraits are of long-dead members of the Durst family.

## Main Hall
When players enter into the Main Hall with illumination.
>[!info] Read Aloud
> The main hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end, and a sweeping red marble staircase at the other. At the base of the staircase is a Grandfather clock. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a portrait. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor. There are four doors along the east wall and another door next to the foyer door on the west wall.

Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of a family: parents with their two  children, the son is holding a doll. A plaque beneath the portrait reads: Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elizabeth Durst with their two children Thornboldt and Rosavalda.
[[The Durst Family.png]]

Anyone who searches the second door from the left will find the cloakroom. It has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.

>[!warning] Search
> Everyone can see vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls or paneling can, with a successful DC 12 check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. 

>[!danger] Event
>Shortly after all of the characters enter the main hall, the front door slams shut, extinguishing all lights in the house. The sound of the rain outside completely vanishes, leaving the house eerily silent.
>Bloody letters then begin appearing on the southern wall, just above the marble staircase. They read as follows:
>
>_Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast_  
>_Who hungers for a bloody feast._  
>_He sleeps until the midnight chime_  
>_Then wakes to feed his dark design._  
>_If morsels seek to flee their doom,_  
>_Then bring toward his secret room_  
>_A gift to soothe his savage mood_  
>_But mind the servants of his brood._
>
> The grandfather clock then strikes six o’clock. Start the dice clock (3d6).

### Room Clues Summary
- The Dursts had two children: **Thornboldt** and **Rosavalda**.
- The house is sealed shut and possibly sentient (front door slams).
- A mysterious poem warns of a **"beast" beneath the house**, servants, and a required **sacrifice**.
- Symbolic decor (serpents, skulls hidden in wall carvings) suggests corruption under beauty.

## Hunter's Den
>[!info] Read Aloud
> As you crack open the door, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.

After players proceed
>[!info] Read Aloud
> The door opens, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone. Positioned around the outskirts of the room are two additional stuffed wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.
>This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head. Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.

The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clumsy stitch-work on their stomachs reads ROSE and THORN, respectively. The table supports a cask of wine, wooden goblets, and a candelabrum. The north cabinet is unlocked and holds a small box containing a deck of playing cards and an assortment of wine glasses and a mounted piece of child's needlework that depicts a boy and girl holding the hands of a young woman, alongside clumsily stitched words that read FOR MISS KLARA. The young woman's face has been slashed and cut out.

>[!warning] **Locked Cabinet**
>The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Thievery check. It holds a heavy crossbow, a light crossbow, a hand crossbow, and 20 bolts for each weapon along with five silvered crossbow bolts. 

>[!warning] **Invisible Trapdoor**
>A trapdoor is hidden in the southwest corner of the floor. It can't be detected or opened until the characters approach it from the underside (see area 32). Until then, Death House supernaturally hides the trapdoor.

>[!danger] Event
> The first time that no players are looking at them, the three taxidermied wolves move. When the players next look at them, the large gray wolf is standing beside the smaller brown wolf, and the first gray wolf has turned its snarl toward the others. Players in the room must make a Will Save DC 15 or gain [[Paranoia]].

### Room Clues Summary
- The stuffed wolves are unnaturally positioned — possibly haunted or enchanted.
- Toys with **Rose** and **Thorn** stitched into them confirm the children's presence here.
- Embroidery labeled **“For Miss Klara”** links the children to a caretaker (likely the nursemaid).
- The woman’s face on the embroidery is slashed out — suggests **violence**, **shame**, or **erasure**.
- Hidden cabinet contains **silvered bolts**, hinting at the presence of **supernatural threats**.

## 4. **KITCHEN AND PANTRY**
>[!info] Read Aloud
> You enter a tidy kitchen, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.
> In the corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall next to a mounted bell.

The thin door leads to a well-stocked pantry (area 4B). All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.

>[!warning] Search
> If the players inspect the cookware, they find that the largest kitchen knife is missing.
> If the players search the pantry, they notice a copper pot stashed behind the rations. Inside the copper pot is a folded piece of delicate lace, a vial of a brownish dried powder, and a bouquet of wilted sunflowers tied to a small scroll of parchment.
> - A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the brown powder as dried silphium, a contraceptive herb.
> - The parchment scroll reads: "For the light of my life. —G."
> - If the players read the note, one of the knives in the kitchen flies off of its shelf and embeds itself in the opposite wall.

>[!warning] **Dumbwaiter**
>Behind the hatch in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to areas 7A (the servants' quarters) and 12A (the master bedroom). The brass bell is attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.
>A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter's rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.

### Room Clues Summary
- Someone recently removed a **large kitchen knife** — possibly the **missing murder weapon**.
- Hidden **contraceptive herb (silphium)** and love note hint at a **secret pregnancy**.
- The note is signed **"—G."**, likely **Gustav Durst**, suggesting an affair with **Miss Klara**.
- **Violent psychic reaction** (knife flies across the room) ties emotional trauma to the house.
- The **dumbwaiter** provides access to servant and master areas, and may carry sound or messages.
- 
## 5. **DINING ROOM**

Players that approach this door can hear the muffled sound of a lively dinner feast, including clinking glasses, quiet laughter, and distant conversation. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the room falls silent, leaving only the stillness and the cold grandeur of the room beyond.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> You enter into a wood-paneled dining room. The centerpiece is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is set with resplendent silverware and crystal glasses polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.
> The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.
> The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma.

The tapestry depicting hunting dogs chasing after a wolf. The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.

>[!warning] Search
 > Characters who search the walls DC Check see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking in the foilage. 

### Room Clues Summary

- The feast is **illusory or cursed** — vanishes or decays when touched or removed.
- The house **mimics normalcy**, but it is a façade — beauty hides rot.
- The **tapestry shows wolves being hunted**, reflecting how predators become prey.
- Carvings of twisted faces and hidden wolves suggest watching eyes and corrupted wilderness.

# Second Floor
## 6. UPPER HALL
>[!info] Read Aloud
> Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. There is a small plain door near the staircase. Hanging above the mantelpiece on the north wall is a longsword. 
> Standing suits of armor flank wooden double doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors between them are carved with images of dancing youths.
> The red marble staircase continues its upward spiral to a third floor, a cold draft whispering down from above.

Longsword with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt.

>[!warning] Search
 > Characters who search the doors DC Check reveal that the youths aren't really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats.

## 7. SERVANTS' ROOM
>[!info] Read Aloud
>This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet. In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it.

Tidy servants' uniforms hang from hooks in the adjoining closet (area 7B). Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A (Kitchen).

## 8. LIBRARY
The master of the house used to spend many hours here before his descent into madness.
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.

The desk has several items resting atop it: an oil lamp, a jar of ink, a quill pen, a tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing the Durst family's insignia (a windmill). The bookshelves hold hundreds of tomes covering a range of topics including history, warfare, and alchemy. Several shelves contain first-edition books of poetry and fiction. The books rot and fall apart if taken from the house.

>[!warning] **Desk**
 > The top drawer of the desk contains a number of receipts for candles, daggers, and incense.
 > On top of the desk the following note:
 > `Dear Mr. and Mrs. Durst,`
 > `In light of my current condition, I respectfully ask your leave for a brief time away from my responsibilities.`
 > `While my devotion to your dear children makes this decision difficult, I have taken it upon myself to find a solution that, I hope, will serve your household well. A good acquaintance of mine is experienced in the care of children, and I believe that she could assume my role during my temporary leave without difficulty.`
 > `I realize that my request is not without its complications. However, my years serving your family have shown me the depth of your understanding and compassion. I truly feel that I have become a part of this family, and I look forward to bringing another member of that family into this world.`
 > `Yours sincerely,`
 > `Klara`

>[!warning] **Secret Door to Secret Room**
> - A character that searches the room for 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret 
> - It can be unlocked and swung open, by pulling on a switch disguised to look like a red-covered book with a blank spine. A character inspecting the bookshelf spots the fake book with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. Unless the secret door is propped open, springs in the hinges cause it to close on its own.
> -  Behind the bookshelf is a plain wall with a small panel made of dark wood, built into the wall at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche, jagged and irregular, lies at the panel's center and emanates a faint amber glow.
> - The door cannot be opened unless the amber shard from the Master Suite is placed into the niche or a player plays _Waltz for Klara_ on the harpsichord in the Conservatory. The secret door then swings open, allowing the players to enter the Secret Room.

### Room Clues Summary

- Klara’s letter confirms:
    - She was **pregnant with Gustav’s child**
    - She arranged a **replacement caretaker** — possibly the nursemaid
    - She considered herself part of the family, adding depth to her ghost's motives
- The **secret door** is hidden but linked to both the **amber shard** and **music**, showing the house’s **emotional + arcane layering**.

## 9. SECRET ROOM

>[!info] Read Aloud
> This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves filled with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton in leather armor.

Close inspection reveals the skeleton triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer's armor and ribcage. The dart-firing mechanism inside the chest no longer functions. Clutched in the skeleton's left hand is a letter with a seal.

Written in flowing script, the letter reads as follows:
```
My most pathetic servant,
I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.
You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. Your husband sired a bastard, and drove you to madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
Your dread lord and master, Strahd von Zarovich
```
>[!warning] **Treasure**
> The chest contains three blank books with black leather covers (worth 25 gp each), three spell scrolls (bless, protection from poison, and spiritual weapon), the deed to the house, and a signed will. The will is signed by Gustav and Elisa- beth Durst and bequeathes the house, the windmill, and all other family property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst in the event of their parents' deaths. The books, scrolls, deeds, and will age markedly if taken from the house but remain intact.

>[!warning] **Study Occult Tomes**
The tomes describe fiend-summoning rituals and the necromantic rituals of a cult called the Priests of Osybus. The rituals are bogus, which any character can ascertain after studying the books for 1 hour and succeeding on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

### Room Clue Summary

- The Dursts were involved in **failed summoning rituals** (bogus texts).
- The **letter from Strahd** mocks them, confirming:
    - They weren’t empowered by him or the Dark Powers
    - **Elisabeth’s madness**, **Gustav’s affair**, and their **child sacrifice** failed to earn them Strahd’s favor
- The **skeleton** shows others have explored and died here.
- The **will and deed** name **Rose and Thorn as heirs**, reinforcing that the children were victims.
- **Occult books** tie the Dursts to the **Priests of Osybus**

## 10. CONSERVATORY
Players that approach this door can hear the faint sound of a harpsichord playing from beyond the doors. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the music falls silent.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> You enter into an elegantly appointed hall, the windows of which are covered by gossamer drapes. A brass-plated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and upholstered chairs line the walls.
> Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece.

Close inspection of the figurines reveals that several are carvings of well-dressed skeletons.

>[!warning] Harpsichord
> A player who inspects the harpsichord finds that one of the keys appears to be permanently pressed in the "down" position. A player who investigates the interior of the harpsichord finds the cause: a rolled-up piece of parchment tucked beneath one of the strings.
> The parchment is a piece of handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled _Waltz for Klara_. 
> If the sheet music is played on the harpsichord, read:
> `As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.`
> `From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.`
> `The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo.`
> `With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist. As her ghostly fist curls around it, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.`
> `Elisabeth's apparition lingers but a moment longer before disappearing with the rest. As it does, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood, originating from the room across the hall. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf: one, toppled over on its side; the other, shattered across the floor.`

### Room Clues Summary

- Playing **_Waltz for Klara_** unlocks both:
    - A **spectral memory** of Elisabeth discovering the affair
    - The **secret room** across the hall
- The **vision shows**
    - Gustav dancing with Klara (or the nursemaid)
    - Elisabeth reacting with **jealousy and fury**
    - The **amber shard** is central to Elisabeth’s spirit

# Third Floor

## 11. BALCONY

>[!info] Read Aloud
> You climb the red marble staircase to its full height, arriving at a dusty balcony. The air here is dry and musty, but tinged with a strange, coppery scent. You can peer down the center of the staircase and see the grandfather clock on the first floor.
> A suit of black plate armor stands against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.

This suit of animated armor attacks as soon as it takes damage or a character approaches within 5 feet of it. It fights until destroyed. It attempts to push a player over the railing using a **_shove_** attack, or attempt to grapple its nearest target before shoving them prone.

**Balance This Encounter**

Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the paneling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, notice tiny corpses hanging from the trees and worms bursting up from the ground.

>[!warning] **Secret Door**
> A secret door in the west wall can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.

## 12. MASTER SUITE

When the players approach the master suite: (PREPARE TO SLIDE DOWN THE AMBIANCE VOLUME AS YOU SPEAK)
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Now atop the stairs, you find yourself before a pair of tall, grand double doors. Each door holds a dusty stained-glass window, their surfaces etched with intricate designs of  windmills—now dulled and obscured by age.
>
>The air seems colder here. Your breath fogs the glass. A hush falls over the house—no creaking, no groaning, only silence.
>
>And then, just beyond the glass, you see it: a silhouette, standing inches behind the doors. Still. Motionless. Dimly lit by a faint amber glow from somewhere within.

Pause here to allow the players to choose an action. If they observe, speak, cast a spell, or open the door, continue with:

> [!info] Read Aloud (if the players interact with the doors)
>As you focus on the figure, your heart begins to race. Though its form is formless—almost a shadow burned into the air—it slowly begins to **turn its head** toward you.
>
>A jolt of icy dread coils in your spine. Frost creeps into the corners of the glass panes as the temperature plummets.
>
>And then—just as suddenly—the silhouette **dissipates**, vanishing like smoke on the wind. The glow fades. The chill lifts. The sounds of the house return, as though nothing had ever been there at all. 

Every player must make a DC 16 will save or receive [[Paranoia]].

As the players enter:
> [!info] Read Aloud
> You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.
> A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.
> A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window.
> The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.

The parlor table has an empty porcelain bowl and a matching jug.
The door facing the bed opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet (area 12B). A door in the parlor leads to an outside balcony (area 12C).

>[!warning] **Dumbwaiter**
>A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.

>[!warning] **Treasure**
>The jewelry box is filled with grain, with an _amber shard_ resting in the center of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the Library) Next to the shard is a rolled parchment.
>`Drasha,`
>`I have selected you as the Beast’s custodian in my absence. Should the Beast grow unruly or show signs of agitation while I am away, I have left this amber shard to weaken it and soothe its fury.`
>`Should the need arise, present the shard and speak the Beast's name; if you speak with conviction, it shall obey you in my stead, if only for a time. But be sure to begone from the house before it awakens fully at midnight.`
>`So long as the Beast draws breath, it—not you—is the heart of this house, and no meal shall ever sate its appetite. Should you linger in its domain, it will mean doom for you all.`
>`Elisabeth`

### Room Clues Summary

- **Amber shard** hidden in the jewelry box is a key to both unlocking secrets and (maybe) influencing the Beast.
- **Elisabeth’s note** reveals:
    - She sees herself as master of the house.
    - She bound the “Beast” to the house.
    - Walter is likely the Beast (though not named outright here).
    - The Beast awakens at **midnight**, creating a time-based tension.

## 13. BATHROOM
This dark room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the east wall. A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.

## 14. STORAGE ROOM
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered broom leans against the far wall.

 When a player first approaches within 5 feet of the **broom**, it attacks as soon as they avert their eyes or turn away, thwacking them once upside the head. It then immediately returns to its initial position. The broom continues to attack any player who remains within 5 feet.

## 15. NURSEMAID'S SUITE

>[!info] Read Aloud
>Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare.
>Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.
>To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries. To the right stands a closed door.
>As you look around the room, you notice that the blankets atop the bed lift slightly away from the mattress, as though something is lying atop the mattress beneath. As you watch, you can see the coverings, almost imperceptibly, slowly rise and fall with low, rhythmic rustling.

The bedroom once belonged to the family's nurse-maid. 

***The Bed.*** A player that removes the covers from the bed finds that there is nothing beneath them. Instead, the player only finds a bloodstained mattress and crude hand-and-foot restraints made from barbed wire nailed to the four posts of the bed frame.

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in Main Hall.

***The Book.*** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled *Blue-Blooded Lips*. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

***The Nursery.*** The door to the nursery is closed. A player who approaches the door hears a young woman's quiet humming. (A player who has previously read or heard the song in the Conservatory recognizes the melody as *Waltz for Klara*.)

If a player enters the nursery, the humming abruptly cuts off. Read:

>[!info] Read Aloud
>The air in this small nursery is strangely warm and tinged with a coppery scent. Blood-red runes cover the walls, arranged in concentric circles around the crib in the center, which seems to have a name carved into its side. Strange, flesh-like tumors have grown along the floor around it in sparse clusters, and slowly pulsate as if they're breathing.
>Looking down, you notice that a small object seems to have fallen beneath the crib. In the distance, you can faintly hear the sound of an infant's soft whimpering.

The object is a severed human finger with several pieces of flesh stripped from it. Tiny toothmarks can be seen around the wounds. A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check identifies the finger as a woman's, and the toothmarks as a human child's.

The name "Walter" has been lovingly carved into the head of the crib. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) identifies the runes around it as dark necromantic magic.

**_The Mirror._** The nursemaid’s **specter** does not appear in this room. Instead, when a player approaches the mirror, the nursemaid’s spirit appears as an apparition in the glass.

>[!warning] **Secret Door**
>A secret door behind the mirror can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.

The spirit resembles a pale, skeletally thin young woman, with all of her fingers and toes removed, her eyes sewn shut, and her lips and teeth torn from her mouth. Countless knife-thin scars line her entire body, including the flesh around her wrists and ankles, and her hair has been carelessly hacked to stubble.

Though its appearance is disturbing, players observing the spirit feel that it is simply observing them with shy curiosity.

The spirit can neither speak aloud nor exit the mirror. However, it shows no hostility toward the players, and can answer basic questions by nodding or shaking its head. It knows everything that the nursemaid did in life. It shows fear at any mention of Mrs. Durst’s name, sorrow at any mention of Mr. Durst’s, melancholic fondness at any mention of Rose or Thorn, and despair at any mention of Walter.

If the players ask the spirit for aid in reaching the basement or finding the “monster,” the spirit steps aside—vanishing from sight—and the secret door behind the mirror slowly swings open. The spirit does not return.

### Room Clues Summary

- The **bloody bed + restraints** strongly imply the nursemaid was tortured (likely by Elisabeth).
- **Romance novel** may be a connection to Gustav's relationship with her.
- **Nursery**:
    - **Runes**, **pulsing flesh**, and **Walter's name** strongly imply necromantic binding.
    - **Severed finger** shows violent infant behavior — probably tied to Walter/Beast.
    - **Tooth marks = human baby** — chilling clue.
- **Specter in the mirror**:
    - Gives information via silent interaction (very cool mechanic).
    - Shows emotional responses to key names — a great method to subtly reveal lore.
    - Opens the way to the attic only if the players **earn her trust**.


# Attic

## 16. ATTIC HALL

>[!info] Read Aloud
>This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.
>A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.

The door to area 20 (Spare Beedroom) is held shut with a padlock. Its key is kept in the library (area 8), but the lock can also be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

## 17. SPARE BEDROOM

>[!info] Read Aloud
>This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A frowning doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box beside a tarnished old music box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.

The players can recognize the doll as the same doll that Thorn was holding in the family portrait in the Main Hall.

The music box contains a rusted, bloodstained skinning knife as well as the key to the padlock on Rose and Thorn's bedroom door.

The music box also contains two curled-up pieces of parchment. The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR. The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.

>[!warning] On Room Exit
>As the players exit the room, the rocking chair begins to rock softly and the music box opens and begins to play. The sound of motherly humming floats through the air for two measures, but grows off-key and distorted before coming to a violent, screeching halt. The rocking chair then stops rocking.

## 18. STORAGE ROOM

>[!info] Read Aloud
>This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.

A character who opens the trunk finds the nursemaid’s corpse, with wounds consistent with those seen on the spirit’s body in the **Nursemaid’s Suite**. 

A DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the woman died of starvation. A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched. Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.

>[!warning] **Secret Door**
>A secret door in the east wall appears only when certain conditions are met; see area 21 for more information.

## 19. SPARE BEDROOM

This web-filled room contains a slender bed, a night- stand, a rocking chair, an empty wardrobe, and a small iron stove.

## 20. CHILDREN'S ROOM

The door to this room is locked from the outside (see area 16 for details).
>[!info] Read aloud
>This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that's a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you also recognize.

The toy chest contains an assortment of stuffed animals and toys. Characters who search the dollhouse and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check find all of the house's secret doors, including one in the attic that leads to a spiral staircase (a miniature replica of area 21).

If either the dollhouse or the chest is disturbed, the ghosts of Rose and Thorn appear in the middle of the room. 

>[!note] Inspiration
> If the party lays the children's spirits to rest, each character gains a point 

## 21. SECRET STAIRS

The secret door and shaft don't exist until the house reveals them, which can happen in one of two ways:
- The characters find Strahd's letter in the secret room behind the library (area 9).
- The characters find the replica secret door in the attic of the dollhouse (area 20). Once the house wills the secret door into existence, characters find it automatically if they search the wall (no ability check required).

Opening the secret door reveals only a stone slab on the opposite side, inset with a small bronze panel at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche identical to the one in the library lies at the panel's center, emanating a faint amber glow. When the niche is exposed, the amber shard from the Master Suite glimmers faintly and swings in the air toward it, as though held aloft by an unseen force.
To allow the stone slab to swing open and reveal the hidden stairs on the opposite side, the players must place the amber shard into the niche.

When the players enter this room, read:
>[!info] Read aloud
>The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase built of aged-looking wood within a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs fill the staircase as it descends into the darkness below.

As the players descend the stairs, read:

>[!info] Read aloud
>The broken cobwebs around you sway like a gossamer wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.
>
>The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears.
>
>Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.
>
>As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.

**_Milestone_**. Descending into Death House's dungeon level completes a story 

# Basement

## 23. FAMILY CRYPTS
Several crypts have been hewn from the earth. Each crypt is sealed with a stone slab unless noted otherwise. Removing a slab from its fitting requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; using a crowbar or the like grants advantage on the check.
### 23A. EMPTY CRYPT
The blank stone slab meant to seal this crypt leans against a nearby wall. The crypt is empty.
### 23B. WALTER'S CRYPT
The stone slab meant to seal this crypt leans against a nearby wall. Etched into it is the name Walter Durst. The crypt is empty.
### 23C. GUSTAV'S CRYPT
The stone slab is etched with the name Gustav Durst. The chamber beyond contains an empty coffin atop a stone bier.
### 23D. ELISABETH'S CRYPT
The stone slab is etched with the name Elisabeth Durst. The crypt contains a stone bier with an empty coffin atop it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) boils out of the back wall and attacks if the coffin is disturbed.
### 23E. ROSE'S CRYPT
The stone slab is etched with the name Rosavalda Durst. The chamber beyond contains an empty coffin on a stone bier.
If Rose's skeletal remains (see area 20) are placed in the coffin, the child's ghost finds peace and disappears forever. A character possessed by Rose's ghost when this occurs is no longer possessed (see also the "Devel- opment" section in area 20).
### 23F. THORN'S CRYPT
The stone slab is etched with the name Thornboldt Durst. The chamber beyond contains an empty coffin on a stone bier.
If Thorn's skeletal remains (see area 20) are placed in the coffin, the child's ghost finds peace and disappears forever. A character possessed by Thorn's ghost when this occurs is no longer possessed (see also the "Devel- opment" section in area 20).

## ENDINGS
The mists of Ravenloft continue to surround Death House until the characters stand atop the dais and either appease or defy the cultists. Strahd is satisfied either way, prompting the mists to recede. THE CULT IS APPEASED
Death House harbors no ill will toward a party willing to sacrifice a life to appease the cult. Once the sacrifice is made, the characters are free to go. Upon emerging from the house, the characters advance to 3rd level. THE CULT IS DENIED
If the characters deny the cult its sacrifice and either destroy the shambling mound or escape from it, Death House attacks them as they try to leave. When they re- turn upstairs, they must roll initiative as they discover several architectural changes:
. All the windows are bricked up; the bricked-up win- dows and the outer walls are impervious to the party's weapon attacks and damage-dealing spells.
• All the doors are gone, replaced by slashing scythe- blades. A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexter- ity (Acrobatics) check to pass through a blade-trapped doorway unscathed. A character who spends 1 minute studying the blades in a particular doorway can try to take advantage of a momentary gap in their repeating movements and make a DC 15 Intelligence check instead. Failing either check, a character takes 2d10 slashing damage but manages to pass through the doorway. Any creature pushed through a doorway must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take the damage. The blades can't be disarmed. . Every room that contains a fireplace, an oven, or a stove is filled with poisonous black smoke. The room is heavily obscured, and any creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 10 Constitu- tion saving throw or take 1d10 poison damage. . The interior walls become rotted and brittle. Each 5-foot-section has AC 5 and 5 hit points, and can also be destroyed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. Each 5-foot section of wall that's destroyed causes a swarm of rats to pour out and at- tack. The swarm won't leave the house.
Keep track of initiative as the characters make their way through the house. Once they escape, they advance to 3rd level, and the house does no more to harm them.
