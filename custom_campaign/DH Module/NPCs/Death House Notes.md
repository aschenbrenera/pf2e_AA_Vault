# Leaving Death House

- A player who opens any outside-facing door or curtain in Death House, or who exits onto any balcony, finds that the exterior of the house has been surrounded by thick, fleshy tendrils. Although the tendrils can be damaged, more grow back swiftly to replace them, sealing the players inside. A player who inspects the tendrils finds that they appear to be extruding from beneath the house.

# Death House Features

- The house has wooden floors throughout.
- None of the rooms in the house are lit when the characters arrive, although most areas contain working oil lamps or fireplaces.
- All windows have hinges that allow them to swing outward.
- The rooms on the first and second floors are free of dust and signs of age.
	- The floorboards and wall panels are well oiled, the drapes and wallpaper haven't faded, and the furniture looks new.
- No effort has been made to preserve the contents of the third floor or the attic. These areas are dusty and drafty, everything within them is old and draped in cobwebs, and the floorboards groan underfoot.

- Ceilings vary in height by floor.
	- The first floor has 10-foot-high ceilings
	- The second floor has 12-foot-high ceilings
	- The third floor has 8-foot-high ceilings
	- The attic has 13-foot-high ceilings.

# Dungeon Features

- The dungeon is carved‏ out of earth, clay, and rock.
- Characters‏ without darkvision must provide their own light sources,‏ as the dungeon is unlit.‏
- The tunnels are 4 feet wide by‏ feet high with timber braces at 5-foot intervals.
- Rooms are 8 feet tall and supported by thick wooden posts with‏ crossbeams.
	- The only exception is area 38, which has a ‏ 16-foot-high ceiling supported by stone pillars.
