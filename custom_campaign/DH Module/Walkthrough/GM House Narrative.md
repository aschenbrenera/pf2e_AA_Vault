# Intro
After the characters complete [[Intro]], start the following.

# Arrival
>[!info] Read Aloud
> A grand manor stands before you. Four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor. It all forms a picture of chilling grandeur.
>
>Directly in front of you is the portico, a stone arch standing before the house's front doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch.
>
>On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.
>
>Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time.
>
>A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.

[[house_front.png]] (Open in Second Window)

The characters who stay outside can see the fog closing in on them, leaving them only the refuge to go inside.

# Ground Floor
## 1. Foyer
When players enter into Foyer, tell them it's too dark to see without light. Then only narrate if there is a light source.
>[!info] Read Aloud
> You step into a dark Foyer, barely lit with a weak oil lamp mounted to the wall. Hanging on the south wall is a shield emblazoned with a coat-of-arms, flanked by framed portraits of stony-faced aristocrats. You see Mahogany-framed double doors set with panes of stained glass leading further into the house.

The coat of arms is a stylized golden windmill on a red field, the portraits are of long-dead members of the Durst family.

## 2. Main Hall
When players enter into the Main Hall with illumination.
>[!info] Read Aloud
> The main hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end, and a sweeping red marble staircase at the other. At the base of the staircase is a Grandfather clock. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a portrait. The wood-paneled walls are ornately sculpted with images. The decorative paneling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor. There are four doors along the east wall and another door next to the foyer door on the west wall.

Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of a family: parents with their two  children, the son is holding a doll. A plaque beneath the portrait reads: Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elizabeth Durst with their two children Thornboldt and Rosavalda.
[[The Durst Family.png]] (Open in Second Window when inspected)

Anyone who searches the second door from the left will find the cloakroom. It has several black cloaks hanging from hooks on the walls. A top hat sits on a high shelf.

>[!warning] Search / Investigate
> Everyone can see vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. Characters who search the walls or paneling can, with a successful DC 14 check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. 

>[!danger] Event
>Shortly after all of the characters enter the main hall, the front door slams shut, extinguishing all flame lights in the house. Then the fireplace roars to life.
>Bloody letters then begin appearing on the southern wall, just above the marble staircase. They read as follows:
>
>_Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast_  
>_Who hungers for a bloody feast._  
>_He sleeps until the midnight chime_  
>_Then wakes to feed his dark design._  
>_If morsels seek to flee their doom,_  
>_Then bring toward his secret room_  
>_A gift to soothe his savage mood_  
>_But mind the servants of his brood._
>
> The grandfather clock then strikes six o’clock. Start the dice clock (6d6).

[[dh_poem.jpeg]] (Open in Second Window)

### Room Clues Summary
- The Durst family and their children: Gustav,  Elizabeth, **Thornboldt** and **Rosavalda**.
- The house is sealed shut and possibly sentient (front door slams).
- A mysterious poem warns of a **"beast" beneath the house**, servants, and a required **sacrifice**.
- Symbolic decor (serpents, skulls hidden in wall carvings) suggests corruption under beauty.

## 3. Hunter's Den
>[!info] Read Aloud
> As you crack open the door, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.

After players proceed
>[!info] Read Aloud
> The door opens, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone. Positioned around the outskirts of the room are two additional stuffed wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.
>This oak-paneled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head. Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.

- The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clumsy stitch-work on their stomachs reads ROSE and THORN, respectively. 
- The table supports a cask of wine, wooden goblets, and a candelabra.
- The north cabinet is unlocked and holds a small box containing a deck of playing cards and an assortment of wine glasses and a mounted piece of child's needlework that depicts a boy and girl holding the hands of a young woman, alongside clumsily stitched words that read FOR MISS KLARA. The young woman's face has been slashed and cut out.

>[!warning] **Locked Cabinet**
>The east cabinet sports a lock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Thievery check. It holds a heavy crossbow, a light crossbow, a hand crossbow, and 20 bolts for each weapon along with five silvered crossbow bolts. 

>[!warning] **Invisible Trapdoor**
>A trapdoor is hidden in the southwest corner of the floor. It can't be detected or opened until the characters approach it from the underside (see area 32). Until then, Death House supernaturally hides the trapdoor.

>[!danger] Event
> The first time that no players are looking at them, the three taxidermied wolves move. When the players next look at them, the large gray wolf is standing beside the smaller brown wolf, and the first gray wolf has turned its snarl toward the others. Players in the room must make a Will Save DC 12 or gain [[Paranoia]].

### Room Clues Summary
- The stuffed wolves are unnaturally positioned — possibly haunted or enchanted.
- Toys with **Rose** and **Thorn** stitched into them confirm the children's presence here.
- Embroidery labeled **“For Miss Klara”** links the children to a caretaker (likely the nursemaid).
- The woman’s face on the embroidery is slashed out — suggests **violence**, **shame**, or **erasure**.
- Hidden cabinet contains **silvered bolts**, hinting at the presence of **supernatural threats**.

## 4. **Kitchen and Pantry**
>[!info] Read Aloud
> You enter a tidy kitchen, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.
> In the corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall next to a mounted bell.

The thin door leads to a well-stocked pantry (area 4B). All the food in the pantry appears fresh but tastes bland.

>[!warning] Search
> If the players inspect the cookware, they find that the largest kitchen knife is missing.
> If the players search the pantry, they notice a copper pot stashed behind the rations. Inside the copper pot is a folded piece of delicate lace, a vial of a brownish dried powder, and a bouquet of wilted sunflowers tied to a small scroll of parchment.
> - A successful DC 14 Nature check identifies the brown powder as dried silphium, a contraceptive herb.
> - The parchment scroll reads: "For the light of my life. —G."
> - If the players read the note, one of the knives in the kitchen flies off of its shelf and embeds itself in the opposite wall. Players in the room must make a Will Save DC 13 or gain [[Paranoia]].

>[!warning] **Dumbwaiter**
>Behind the hatch in the southwest corner of the kitchen is a dumbwaiter a 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to areas 7A (the servants' quarters) and 12A (the master bedroom). The brass bell is attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.
>A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter's rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.

### Room Clues Summary
- Someone recently removed a **large kitchen knife** — possibly the **missing murder weapon**.
- Hidden **contraceptive herb (silphium)** and love note hint at a **secret pregnancy**.
- The note is signed **"—G."**, likely **Gustav Durst**, suggesting an affair with **Miss Klara**.
- **Violent psychic reaction** (knife flies across the room) ties emotional trauma to the house.
- The **dumbwaiter** provides access to servant and master areas, and may carry sound or messages.
- 
## 5. **Dining Room**
Players that approach this door can hear the muffled sound of a lively dinner feast, including clinking glasses, quiet laughter, and distant conversation. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the room falls silent, leaving only the stillness and the cold grandeur of the room beyond.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> You enter into a wood-paneled dining room. The centerpiece is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is set with resplendent silverware and crystal glasses polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.
> The wall paneling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.
> The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma.

The tapestry depicting hunting dogs chasing after a wolf. The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.

>[!warning] Search
 > Characters who search the walls DC 14 Check see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking in the foliage. 

# Second Floor
## 6. Upper Hall
>[!info] Read Aloud
> Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. There is a small plain door near the staircase. Hanging above the mantelpiece on the north wall is a longsword. 
> Standing suits of armor flank wooden double doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a glaive and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors between them are carved with images of dancing youths.
> The red marble staircase continues its upward spiral to a third floor, a cold draft whispering down from above.

Longsword with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt.

>[!warning] Search
 > Characters who search the doors DC Check reveal that the youths aren't really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats.

## 7. Servant's Room
>[!info] Read Aloud
>This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet. In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it.

Tidy servants' uniforms hang from hooks in the adjoining closet (area 7B). Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A (Kitchen).

## 8. Library
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.

The desk has several items resting atop it: an oil lamp, a jar of ink, a quill pen, a tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing the Durst family's insignia (a windmill). The bookshelves hold hundreds of tomes covering a range of topics including history, warfare, and alchemy. Several shelves contain first-edition books of poetry and fiction. The books rot and fall apart if taken from the house.

>[!warning] **Desk**
 > The top drawer of the desk contains a number of receipts for candles, daggers, and incense.
 > On top of the desk the following note:
 > `Dear Mr. and Mrs. Durst,`
 > `In light of my current condition, I respectfully ask your leave for a brief time away from my responsibilities.`
 > `While my devotion to your dear children makes this decision difficult, I have taken it upon myself to find a solution that, I hope, will serve your household well. A good acquaintance of mine is experienced in the care of children, and I believe that she could assume my role during my temporary leave without difficulty.`
 > `I realize that my request is not without its complications. However, my years serving your family have shown me the depth of your understanding and compassion. I truly feel that I have become a part of this family, and I look forward to bringing another member of that family into this world.`
 > `Yours sincerely,`
 > `Klara`

>[!warning] **Secret Door to Secret Room**
> - A character that searches the room for 1 minute and succeeds on a DC 15 Perception check can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret 
> - It can be unlocked and swung open, by pulling on a switch disguised to look like a red-covered book with a blank spine. A character inspecting the bookshelf spots the fake book with a successful DC 13 Perception check. Unless the secret door is propped open, springs in the hinges cause it to close on its own.
> -  Behind the bookshelf is a plain wall with a small panel made of dark wood, built into the wall at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche, jagged and irregular, lies at the panel's center and emanates a faint amber glow.
> - The door cannot be opened unless the amber shard from the Master Suite is placed into the niche or a player plays _Waltz for Klara_ on the harpsichord in the Conservatory. The secret door then swings open, allowing the players to enter the Secret Room.

### Room Clues Summary
- Klara’s letter confirms:
    - She was **pregnant with Gustav’s child**
    - She arranged a **replacement caretaker** — possibly the nursemaid
    - She considered herself part of the family, adding depth to her ghost's motives
- The **secret door** is hidden but linked to both the **amber shard** and **music**, showing the house’s **emotional + arcane layering**.

## 9. Secret Room
>[!info] Read Aloud
> This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves filled with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton in leather armor.

Close inspection reveals the skeleton triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer's armor and ribcage. The dart-firing mechanism inside the chest no longer functions. Clutched in the skeleton's left hand is a letter with a seal.

Written in flowing script, the letter reads as follows:
```
My most pathetic servant,
I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not in my favor. You are but worms writhing in my earth.
You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. Your husband sired a bastard, and drove you to madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
~~Your dread lord and master, Strahd von Zarovich~~
```
>[!warning] **Treasure**
> The chest contains three blank books with black leather covers (worth 25 gp each), three spell scrolls (bless and two heal), the deed to the house, and a signed will. The will is signed by Gustav and Elisa- beth Durst and bequeathes the house, the windmill, and all other family property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst in the event of their parents' deaths. The books, scrolls, deeds, and will age markedly if taken from the house but remain intact.

>[!warning] **Study Occult Tomes**
The tomes describe fiend-summoning rituals and the necromantic rituals of a death cult. The rituals are bogus, which any character can ascertain after studying the books for 20 minutes and succeeding on a DC 12 Occultism check.

### Room Clue Summary
- The Dursts were involved in **failed summoning rituals** (bogus texts).
- The **letter from Strahd** mocks them, confirming:
    - They weren’t empowered by him or the Dark Powers
    - **Elisabeth’s madness**, **Gustav’s affair**, and their **child sacrifice** failed to earn them Strahd’s favor
- The **skeleton** shows others have explored and died here.
- The **will and deed** name **Rose and Thorn as heirs**, reinforcing that the children were victims.
- **Occult books** tie the Dursts to the **Priests of Osybus**

## 10. Conservatory
Players that approach this door can hear the faint sound of a harpsichord playing from beyond the doors. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the music falls silent.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> You enter into an elegantly appointed hall, the windows of which are covered by gossamer drapes. A brass-plated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and upholstered chairs line the walls.
> Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece.

Close inspection of the figurines reveals that several are carvings of well-dressed skeletons.

>[!warning] Harpsichord
> A player who inspects the harpsichord finds that one of the keys appears to be permanently pressed in the "down" position. A player who investigates the interior of the harpsichord finds the cause: a rolled-up piece of parchment tucked beneath one of the strings.
> The parchment is a piece of handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled _Waltz for Klara_. 
> If the sheet music is played on the harpsichord, read the following passage

>[!info] Read Aloud - If sheet music is played on the harpsichord
> As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.
> From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.
> The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo. As they do, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood emanates from the room across the hall
> With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist. As her ghostly fist curls around it, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.
> Elisabeth's apparition lingers a moment longer before she turns and looks at you (piano player). She dissipates, then suddenly all the piano keys become depressed at once. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf.

Players in the room must make a Will Save DC 13 or gain [[Paranoia]].

### Room Clues Summary
- Playing **_Waltz for Klara_** unlocks both:
    - A **spectral memory** of Elisabeth discovering the affair
    - The **secret room** across the hall
- The **vision shows**
    - Gustav dancing with Klara (or the nursemaid)
    - Elisabeth reacting with **jealousy and fury**
    - The **amber shard** is central to Elisabeth’s spirit

# Third Floor

## 11. Balcony
>[!info] Read Aloud
> You climb the red marble staircase to its full height, arriving at a dusty balcony. The air here is dry and musty, but tinged with a strange, coppery scent. You can peer down the center of the staircase and see the grandfather clock on the first floor.
> Two suits of black plate armor stand against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-paneled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.

This suits of Animated Armor attack as soon as it takes damage or a character approaches within 5 feet of it. It fights until destroyed. It attempts to push a player over the railing (Fall 30 feet 30 damage, or try to - [[Grab an Edge]] vs DC 12) attack, or attempt to grapple its nearest target before shoving them prone. USE EXIGENCY SCENES.

(PREPARE AMBIANCE AUDIO IN SIDE TAB)

Characters who search or inspect the walls notice tiny corpses hanging from the trees and worms bursting up from the ground.

>[!warning] **Secret Door**
> A secret door in the west wall can be found with a successful DC 15 Perception check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.

## 12. Master Suite
When the players approach the master suite: (PREPARE TO SLIDE DOWN THE AMBIANCE VOLUME AS YOU SPEAK)
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Now atop the stairs, you find yourself before a pair of tall, grand double doors. Each door holds a dusty stained-glass window, their surfaces etched with intricate designs of  windmills—now dulled and obscured by age.
>
>The air seems colder here. Your breath fogs the glass. A hush falls over the house; no creaking, no groaning, only silence.
>
>And then, just beyond the glass, you see it: a silhouette, standing inches behind the doors. Still. Motionless. Dimly lit by a faint amber glow from somewhere within.

Pause here to allow the players to choose an action. If they observe, speak, cast a spell, or open the door, continue with:

> [!info] Read Aloud (if the players interact with the doors)
>As you start to act, you pause. The silhouette is changing. It slowly begins to **turn its head** toward you.
> -- Make a Will Save --
>A jolt of icy dread coils in your spine. Frost creeps into the corners of the glass panes as the temperature plummets.
>
>And then the silhouette **dissipates**, vanishing like smoke on the wind. The glow fades. The chill lifts. The sounds of the house return, as though nothing had ever been there at all. 

Every player must make a DC 16 will save or receive [[Paranoia]].

As the players enter:
> [!info] Read Aloud
> You enter a dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom with burgundy drapes covering the windows. A four-poster bed with embroidered curtains and tattered gossamer veils stands against the center wall.
> A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.
> A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window.
> The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.

The parlor table has an empty porcelain bowl and a matching jug.

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the parlor door and onto the balcony (area 12C) sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[Death House Notes]].
The door facing the bed opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet (area 12B).

>[!warning] **Dumbwaiter**
>A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in area 4A.

>[!warning] **Treasure**
>The jewelry box is filled with grain, with an _amber shard_ resting in the center of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the Library) Next to the shard is a rolled parchment. Read the following.

> [!info] Read Aloud
>Drasha,
>I have selected you as the Beast’s custodian in my absence. Should the Beast grow unruly or show signs of agitation while I am away, I have left this amber shard to weaken it and soothe its fury.
>Should the need arise, present the shard and speak the Beast's name; if you speak with conviction, it shall obey you in my stead, if only for a time. But be sure to begone from the house before it awakens fully at midnight.
>So long as the Beast draws breath, it—not you—is the heart of this house, and no meal shall ever sate its appetite. Should you linger in its domain, it will mean doom for you all.`
>Elisabeth

### Room Clues Summary
- **Amber shard** hidden in the jewelry box is a key to both unlocking secrets and (maybe) influencing the Beast.
- **Elisabeth’s note** reveals:
    - She sees herself as master of the house.
    - She bound the “Beast” to the house.
    - Walter is likely the Beast (though not named outright here).
    - The Beast awakens at **midnight**, creating a time-based tension.

## 13. Bathroom
This room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the east wall. 

A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.

## 14. Storage Room
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered broom leans against the far wall.

 When a player first approaches within 5 feet of the **broom**, it attacks as soon as they avert their eyes or turn away (target Off-Guard), thwacking them once upside the head. It then immediately returns to its initial position. The broom continues to attack any player who remains within 5 feet.

## 15. Nursemaid's Suite
>[!info] Read Aloud
>Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare.
>Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.
>To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries. To the right stands a closed door.
>As you look around the room, you notice that the blankets atop the bed lift slightly away from the mattress, as though something is lying atop the mattress beneath. As you watch, you can see the coverings, almost imperceptibly, slowly rise and fall with low, rhythmic rustling.

The bedroom once belonged to the family's nurse-maid. 

***The Bed.*** A player that removes the covers from the bed finds that there is nothing beneath them. Instead, the player only finds a bloodstained mattress and crude hand-and-foot restraints nailed to the four posts of the bed frame.

***The Doors.*** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony (Area 15C) sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[Death House Notes]].

***The Book.*** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled *Blue-Blooded Lips*. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

***The Nursery.*** The door to the nursery is closed. A player who approaches the door hears a young woman's quiet humming. (A player who has previously read or heard the song in the Conservatory recognizes the melody as *Waltz for Klara*.)

If a player enters the nursery (Area 15B), the humming abruptly cuts off. Read:

>[!info] Read Aloud
>The air in this small nursery is strangely warm and tinged with a coppery scent. Blood-red runes cover the walls, arranged in concentric circles around the crib in the center, which seems to have a name carved into its side. Strange, flesh-like tumors have grown along the floor around it in sparse clusters, and slowly pulsate as if they're breathing.
>Looking down, you notice that a small object seems to have fallen beneath the crib. In the distance, you can faintly hear the sound of an infant's soft whimpering.

The object is a severed human finger with several pieces of flesh stripped from it. Tiny toothmarks can be seen around the wounds. A DC 12 Medicine check identifies the finger as a woman's, and the toothmarks as a human child's.

The name "Walter" has been lovingly carved into the head of the crib.

A successful DC 14 Occult, DC 16 Religion, DC 20 Arcana identifies the runes around it as sinister occult transmutation magic. Scattered runes around the room also seem to be necromancy magic.

**_The Mirror._** When a player approaches the mirror, the nursemaid’s spirit appears as an apparition in the glass. Though its appearance is disturbing, players observing the spirit feel that it is simply observing them with shy curiosity.

>[!info] Read Aloud
> The apparition of a pale, skeletally thin young woman appears in the mirror. She has clearly been tortured and disfigured. Most notably there are countless knife-thin scars line her entire body, and her fingers and toes have been removed. The apparition stays patiently still.

The spirit can neither speak aloud nor exit the mirror. However, it shows no hostility toward the players, and can answer basic questions by nodding or shaking its head. It knows everything that the nursemaid did in life. It shows fear at any mention of Mrs. Durst’s name, sorrow at any mention of Mr. Durst’s, melancholic fondness at any mention of Rose or Thorn, and despair at any mention of Walter.

If the players ask the spirit for aid in reaching the basement or finding the “monster,” the spirit steps aside—vanishing from sight—and the secret door behind the mirror slowly swings open. The spirit does not return.

>[!warning] **Secret Door** 
>If not revealed by the spirit, the secret door behind the mirror can be found with a successful DC 15 Perception check. It pushes open easily to reveal a cobweb-filled wooden staircase leading up to the attic.


### Room Clues Summary
- The **bloody bed + restraints** strongly imply the nursemaid was tortured (likely by Elisabeth).
- **Romance novel** may be a connection to Gustav's relationship with her.
- **Nursery**:
    - **Runes**, **pulsing flesh**, and **Walter's name** strongly occult transmutation magic, some necromancy magic too.
    - **Severed finger** shows violent infant behavior — probably tied to Walter/Beast.
    - **Tooth marks = human baby** 
- **Specter in the mirror**:
    - Gives information via silent interaction.
    - Shows emotional responses to key names — a great method to subtly reveal lore.
    - Opens the way to the attic only if the players want to to find monster/Walter/basement.

# Attic
## 16. Attic Hall
>[!info] Read Aloud
>This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.
>A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.

The open door leads to the Spare Bedroom.

The door to the Children's Room (Area 20) is held shut with a [[Lock]] (simple). The key is in the spare bedroom.

## 17. Spare Bedroom
>[!info] Read Aloud
>This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A  tarnished old music box sits in the northern window box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.

Inside the Music Box
- A rusted, bloodstained skinning knife
- **A small brass key** (that unlocks the padlock to the Children's room)
- **Two curled pieces of parchment**
	- [[Death House Dungeon Map.png]] - The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR.
	- The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.

>[!warning] On Room Exit
>As the players exit the room, the rocking chair begins to rock softly and the music box opens and begins to play. The sound of motherly humming floats through the air for two measures, but grows off-key and distorted before coming to a violent, screeching halt. The rocking chair then stops rocking.  Players in the room must make a Will Save DC 14 or gain [[Paranoia]].

## 18. Storage Room
>[!info] Read Aloud
>This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.

The Trunk: Beneath the sheet is a heavy wooden trunk. Opening it reveals the **corpse of a woman**, curled unnaturally within.

- Her body bears wounds consistent with those seen on the nursemaid’s ghost in the **Nursemaid’s Suite**.
- Her clothing marks her as a household servant.
- A DC 15 Medicine (Forensic Evaluation 10 min.) check reveals that the woman died of starvation. 

>[!warning] Inspect Body
>A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched. Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.

>[!warning] **Secret Door**
>A secret door in the east wall appears only when certain conditions are met; see area 21 for more information.
>
## 19. Guest Bedroom
This web-filled room contains a slender bed, a night- stand, a rocking chair, an empty wardrobe, and a small iron stove.

## 20. Children's Room
Door: The door to this room is locked from the outside (see area 16 for details).

>[!info] Read aloud
>This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Near the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that's a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs.
>In the center of the floor lie two small skeletons, clad in tattered but heartbreakingly familiar clothing. The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you recognize.

The Doll
- Players who saw the family portrait in the Main Hall know the doll is **identical to the one Thorn holds** in the portrait.

**Toy Chest:** Filled with stuffed animals, carved toys, and dolls. Nothing of monetary value.

>[!warning] **Dollhouse**
>- A near-perfect scale model of Death House, including interior rooms.
>	- The dollhouse contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted molds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house and in their relative location. 
>- A character who **searches the dollhouse** can attempt a **Perception check**:
>- **DC 17 Perception**
>	- **Success:** The character discovers that the dollhouse contains tiny, hidden panels matching the house’s secret doors.
>	- **Critical Success:** As above, and the character notices a hidden attic panel concealing a spiral staircase—corresponding to a secret route in the real house (see **Area 21**).
>- **GM Note:** This is an investigation moment, not a gotcha. If the party engages meaningfully with the dollhouse, you can grant a success without rolling.

>[!warning] The Children’s Ghosts
>If **either the toy chest, the doll, or the dollhouse is disturbed**, the ghosts of **Rose and Thorn** manifest in the center of the room.
>- They do not attack immediately.
>- They are frightened, confused, and desperate to be heard.
>- Use them as a roleplaying encounter [[Rose and Thorn]] that reinforces:
>	- They were locked in this rooms
>	- Their parents abandoned theme
>	- Something _below the house_ terrifies them
>	- Don't play with their toys.
>	- When the secret door is revealed, Thorn shyly asks the players if he and Rose can accompany them downstairs to aid them

### Room Clue Summary
- **Skeletons:** The children died trapped in this room, likely of neglect or starvation.
- **Stuffed Doll:** Confirms the identity of Rose and Thorn.
- **Dollhouse Layout:** Reveals the house has secret doors and foreshadows the existence of a hidden descent to the basement.

## 21. Secret Stairs
The secret door and staircase **do not exist** until the house allows them to.

This happens when the characters discover the **hidden attic staircase** in the dollhouse (Area 20). After that any character **searching the appropriate wall automatically finds the secret door**; No check is required.

>[!warning] The Amber Mechanism
>Opening the secret door reveals a **stone slab** blocking the way forward.
>- Set into the slab is a **small bronze panel** at chest height.
>- At its center is a shallow niche, faintly glowing with amber light.
>
>If the party possesses the **amber shard** from the Master Suite:
>- The shard **glimmers and floats** toward the niche when it is exposed.
>- Placing the shard into the niche causes the slab to **swing open silently**, revealing the staircase beyond.
>- **GM Note:** This is a narrative lock, not a puzzle. If the party has the shard, let it work cleanly.

When the players first see the stairs, read:
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> 
> The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase of ancient wood, winding downward through a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs clog the descent, and the darkness below seems to swallow all light.

As the party descends, read:

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> 
> The shattered cobwebs sway in the air as the stairs creak and groan beneath your weight. The spiral draws you deeper—one floor, then another, then another still.
> 
> The walls narrow until you must hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue. In the darkness, the sound of your own breathing and pounding blood feels unbearably loud.
> 
> At last, the descent levels out onto a packed-earth landing. A narrow tunnel reinforced with aged timber stretches ahead, its stone walls streaked with dark red clay. Eight feet in, the passage splits—one branch left, one right.
> 
> As your senses adjust, you realize the corridor is not silent. A deep, rhythmic sound echoes through the earth below—low, constant chanting.

**Milestone:**  
Descending into Death House’s dungeon level marks the completion of the _Exploration_ phase of the house and begins the _Confrontation_ phase below.
You may award:
- A **level up**, if using milestone advancement
- Or a **Hero Point to each character**, to prepare them for what lies ahead

# Basement
The dungeon/basement is carved out of earth, clay, and rock. The tunnels are 4 feet wide by 7 feet high with timber braces at 5 foot intervals. Rooms are 8 feet tall and supported by thick wooden posts with crossbeams. Characters without darkvision must use a light source.

## 23. Family Crypts
A network of narrow burial tunnels extends from the dungeon corridors. Burial alcoves have been hewn directly from packed earth and stone. Each crypt is sealed with a heavy stone slab unless otherwise noted.

The air here is unnaturally still, and sound seems muted, as though swallowed by the earth itself.

**Opening Crypts**
- **Stone Slabs:** Thick stone slabs fitted into grooves or leaning nearby.
- **Athletics Check:**  DC 17 to shift or remove a sealed slab.
- **Time Pressure:**  Removing a slab takes approximately **1 minute** and produces echoing stone-on-stone noise audible throughout nearby tunnels.
- **GM Note:** Allow tension to build naturally. These crypts are meant to unsettle through implication and atmosphere rather than urgency.

Approaching the Empty Crypt & Walter’s Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> This side corridor branches to the left and right. On either side, large stone slabs lean against the walls, opening the way to a pair of dark, silent crypts. The slab to the right is etched with the name *Walter Durst*. The slab to the left bears no name.

23A. Empty Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> You peer past the leaning stone slab into an empty earthen crypt.

- The crypt contains no coffin, remains, or offerings.
- Subtle disturbances in the dirt suggest something was once interred here, then removed long ago.

23B. Walter's Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The walls of this crypt are marred by swollen, discolored growths embedded in the stone itself. They pulse faintly, occasionally rupturing and then going still. Each time they do, a faint infant’s whimper echoes briefly through the chamber before being smothered by the sound of distant humming.

- Characters who have previously heard the lullaby recognize the melody as **“Waltz for Klara.”**
- **GM Note:**  This crypt confirms that Walter was never properly buried. Keep the description suggestive rather than explicit—the horror lies in implication.

Approaching Gustav’s Crypt & Elisabeth’s Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The corridor branches again. Heavy stone slabs seal the tunnels on either side. One is etched *Gustav Durst*; the other *Elisabeth Durst*. A thin mist clings to the floor, and the silence here feels oppressive.

23C. Gustav’s Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> Beyond the slab lies a lonely crypt containing a stone coffin resting atop a dusty stone bier. The chamber is deathly quiet.

23D. Elisabeth’s Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> A thick, acrid haze fills this crypt. A stone coffin rests atop a bier, while the floor before it is carpeted with the bodies of dead insects. At the center lies an unnaturally large termite queen, surrounded by the remains of other warped beetles.

Approaching Rose’s & Thorn’s Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud** 
> The corridor branches once more. Stone slabs seal both passages—*Rosavalda Durst* to the left, *Thornboldt Durst* to the right. Each slab radiates the stillness of a forgotten grave.

23E–F. Rose’s & Thorn’s Crypt
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> This small chamber contains a stone coffin resting atop a stone bier. The air hangs heavy with sorrow.

- Both crypts contain **empty coffins**.
-  If accompanying the party, neither Rose nor Thorn finds comfort here. The children instinctively wish to leave this place quickly and do not see these crypts as home or refuge.

## 24. Cult Initiates' Quarters
As the characters move to descend to the Cultist Quarters, a sudden splashing sound can be heard—which then quickly subsides.

A wooden table and four chairs stand at the east end of this room. To the west are four alcoves containing moldy straw pallets.

## 25. Well and Cultist's Quarters
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The ceiling of this dark, earthen chamber rises a foot higher than the cramped tunnel. Thick wooden posts and crossbeams support the room, though they are badly rotted.
>  
>  At the center of the chamber stands a lonely stone well. Along three walls, several small alcove-like rooms have been carved into the earth. Old footprints crisscross the dusty floor, leading into the alcoves, circling the well, and continuing toward a staircase at the far end of the room.
>   
>   An old hempen rope, attached to a rusted pulley, descends into the well. It sways faintly in the stagnant air, as if recently disturbed.

The Well
- **Dimensions:**   A 4-foot-diameter shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip
- **Depth:**   Descends **30 feet** to a water-filled cistern
- **Features:**  
  - A wooden bucket hangs from the rope-and-pulley mechanism
  - The interior stonework is coated in an ash-black fungus

If a character tosses an object down the well and then turns away, they hear **violent splashing and tearing sounds** echo from below. When they look back, the object is gone, or what remains has been torn apart, with large pieces missing.
**GM Note:**  No creature is visible. Let the players draw their own conclusions. The well should feel dangerous without explanation.

Each alcove contains:
- A crude wooden bed with a moldy straw mattress
- A wooden footlocker for personal belongings using a Simple [[Lock]].

>[!warning] Treasure by Alcove
> **GM Note:**  Aside from the listed items, the footlockers contain only rotted clothing and minor personal effects. Let the first footlocker they open be Drasha's Journal, then adjust accordingly.
> - **25A:**  A small pouch containing **20 gp **, stitched from disturbingly preserved leather.
> - **25B:**  Three **moss agates** (worth **10 gp each**) wrapped in black cloth.
> - **25C:**   A black leather eyepatch set with a **carnelian gem** (worth **50 gp**).
> - **25D:**   An **ivory hairbrush with silver bristles** (worth **25 gp**).
> - **25E:**   A **journal bound in grimy black leather**, signed by *Drasha*.

>[!warning] Drasha’s Journal (from 25E)
>The journal contains a list of names paired with brief physical descriptions. Each entry includes cold, clinical notes on ritual sacrifice preparations and ends with the same repeated phrase:  *“Fed to Walter.”*
>The writing avoids emotion, treating the victims as inventory rather than people.

### Room Clue Summary
- **The Journal:** Confirms repeated sacrifices and Walter’s role in them.

## 26. Hidden Spiked Pit
The chanting that echoes throughout the dungeon grows noticeably louder in this area, drawing the party toward the deeper levels of the complex.

This corridor contains a concealed pit trap designed to catch intruders who follow the sound without caution. The corridor’s unusual cleanliness is intentional—no footprints cross the trapped section of floor.

- Emphasize **sound** and **cleanliness** as the primary warning signs.
- Avoid rushing this moment—let player paranoia do the work.

From the Well and Cultist Quarters
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The staircase leads to a quiet landing. Ahead, the stairs continue upward and vanish around a bend. To the right, the landing extends into a lonely corridor. This tunnel looks surprisingly clean and free of debris; at its far end, another earthen staircase descends into darkness.  
>  
> The incessant chanting that has filled the underground complex grows louder toward the descending stairs.

From the Dining Hall
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The staircase descends to a quiet landing. Ahead, the stairs continue downward into a broader chamber. To the left, the landing stretches into a lonely corridor. The tunnel appears unusually clean, and at its far end another earthen staircase leads deeper underground.  
>  
> The chanting grows stronger toward the far end of the corridor.

From the Ghoulish Encounter
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The staircase descends to a quiet landing. To the left, the stairs continue downward, rounding a bend before vanishing into darkness. The chanting echoes most strongly from below.  
>  
> To the right, the landing continues into a lonely corridor. The tunnel is oddly clean, and at its far end it branches left and right.

>[!warning] The Hidden Pit Trapped
>- **Passive Clue:**  The absence of footprints may prompt suspicion.
>- **Overview:** Characters searching the floor for traps find a 5-foot-long, 10-foot-deep [[Hidden Pit]] under several rotted wooden planks, all hidden under a thin layer of dirt. The pit has sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom.
>- **Damage:** The first character to step on the cover falls through, landing prone and taking 10 bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 2d10 piercing damage from the spikes.
>- This hazard doesn't have the mechanical trait.
>- **GM Note:**  On a critical failure of the Gran an Edge, you may also apply **1d6 persistent bleed damage** if you want to increase tension—but this is optional for a one-shot.
>- **Escaping the Pit**
>	- **Climb:**  **Athletics DC 15** to climb out
>	- **Assisted Escape:**   A rope or help from above reduces the DC by 2
>	- **Failure:**    No progress; critical failure results in a fall back into the pit

## 27–28. Dining Room and Larder
This chamber once served as a communal feasting area for the cult, with a storage alcove to the south that now hides something far more dangerous.

Entering Dining Room
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie scattered across the dirt floor. A thick, coppery stench of decay hangs in the air, heavy enough to cling to the back of your throat.  
>  
> In a dark alcove along the south wall, countless bones have been stacked into a crude, misshapen pyramid.

- The bones are humanoid and badly gnawed.
- No useful items remain among them.
- The bone pile appears intentionally arranged, as if part of a ritual display.

>[!warning] Encounter in the Larder (Southern Alcove)
The southern alcove once functioned as a storage space for food. 

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> As you approach the alcove, you see a grotesque fleshy mass emerge from behind the pyramid of bones. Roughly the height of a human, but the body slug warped into a horrid slug like form. It drops a bone from it's mouth and begins to slither forward.

## 29. Ghoulish Encounter
This four-way tunnel intersection marks a turning point in the dungeon. The chanting that has followed the party grows stronger beyond this area, and the cult’s former members rise to bar the way.

As you approach corridor
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> A deathly stench wafts from this corridor. The stone walls are smeared with cracked, dark red stains, and a scattered trail of old bones are strewn deeper down the tunnel.

![[GhoulishEncounterMap.png]]

>[!warning] Ghoulish Encounter
>When the first character steps into one of the **5-foot squares at the corridor entrances** (marked **T** on the map), the ambush is triggered.
>- **Emergence:**  The ghouls claw their way up from shallow graves beneath the tunnel floor in the spaces marked **S** on the map.png
>	- Characters who do not anticipate the ambush may begin combat **off-guard**, at the GM’s discretion.
>- As the ghouls attack, they mutter fragments of broken devotion, repeating phrases such as:
>	- **GM Note:** Deliver these lines flatly and without emotion. The ghouls are not pleading—they are reciting beliefs drilled into them long ago.
>	- *“Beautiful. We’re so beautiful.”*
>	- *“We are perfect. We are immortal.”*
>	- *“Help us live forever.”*
>- The ghouls fight **mindlessly**, focusing on the nearest living creatures. They do not retreat or surrender.

- Insert 3 Ghoul Soldiers (Maybe will less HP / emaciated)

### Continuing Forward
If the party advances past the ambush and reaches the center of the intersection, read:

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The trail of bones ends at the center of a silent intersection. The chanting you’ve heard since entering the dungeon is unmistakably louder down the northern passage.

## 30. STAIRS DOWN
It's obvious to any character standing at the top of this 20-foot-long staircase that the ghostly chants originate from somewhere below. Characters who descend the stairs and follow the hall beyond arrive in area 35. 

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> A dark set of chiseled stone steps descends into darkness. It's clear that the origin of the muffled chanting you've been hearing lies below.

## 31–32. Darklord’s Shrine and Hidden Trapdoor
This chamber serves as the cult’s place of worship—and a final test of restraint before escape.

### Darklord’s Shrine
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> This room is festooned with moldy skeletons hanging from rusty shackles along the walls, their jaws frozen open in silent screams.  
>  
> A wide alcove in the south wall holds a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak. His left hand rests atop the head of a wolf at his side, while his right hand presents a smoky-gray crystal orb. The statue’s painted eyes seem to glare downward with cold, cruel awareness.  
>  
> Five ashen shadows are burned into the walls around the statue, with dark streaks trailing across the floor toward it.  
>  
> Exits lead to the west and north. Chanting echoes most strongly from the north.

### The Crystal Orb
A character who approaches within **5 feet** of the statue feels an oppressive presence.

- The character hears faint whispers:
  - *“His gaze burns upon us.”*
  - *“The Darklord’s eyes are always watching.”*
- The character’s own shadow begins to writhe unnaturally along the floor.
- A character who **touches the orb** experiences the unmistakable sensation that an ancient, malevolent intelligence has noticed them.

### Shadow Guardians
The ashen silhouettes on the walls are dormant spirits of former cultists.

#### Trigger
- If the orb is **removed from the statue**, the shadows begin to awaken.
- If the orb is returned to its place on the statue, the shadows return to their original positions and become dormant once more.

#### Awakening Shadows
- At the end of each round after the orb is removed, a shadow peels free from the walls.
- As they stir, they murmur:
  - *“Begone from this place.”*
  - *“Look not upon us.”*
  - *“Return the Darklord’s offering.”*

Once all shadows have awakened, they attack.

#### Combat Notes
- **Creatures:** Shadows (use standard PF2e shadows)
- Each shadow prefers to target a **different character**, spreading fear and pressure.
- The shadows **pursue fleeing characters**, but do not leave the dungeon level.

### Hidden Trapdoor (Former Area 32)
A concealed exit lies within the shrine.

#### Finding the Door
- **Seek:** **Perception DC 10** to notice a concealed door in the east wall
- The door is a rotted wooden panel hidden beneath packed clay

Opening it reveals a short stone staircase leading upward.

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The clay staircase ends at a cramped landing. Six feet overhead, a half-rotted ceiling of close-fitting planks holds a closed wooden trapdoor leading to an upper floor. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side.

- The trapdoor opens into **Area 3 (the Den)** above.
- Once opened, it remains a permanent route between floors.

## 33–34. Cult Leaders’ Den and Quarters
These rooms mark the former living and ritual spaces of the cult leaders, suffused with the stench of death and decay.

### Cult Leaders’ Den (Area 33)
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> This quiet room contains a wooden table flanked by two high-backed chairs, holding a clay jug and two flagons.  
> Above the table hangs an unlit cast-iron chandelier. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners of the chamber, their candles long since melted away.  
> A short corridor at the north end of the room leads to a darkened chamber beyond.

- The room is otherwise empty.

### Cult Leaders’ Quarters (Area 34)
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> This room contains a large wood-framed bed, the feather mattress rotted through.  
> An old wooden wardrobe carved with demonic faces stands against the wall to the left, and a faded wooden footlocker rests at the foot of the bed.  
> The room is suffused with a familiar stench of death—stronger here, mixed with a noxious odor that fills your lungs.  

- The wardrobe contains:
  - Several old robes
  - A pair of iron candlesticks
  - An open crate with thirty torches and a leather sack holding fifteen candles
  -  A rotting aroma also emanates from a pair of rotted organs—a half-eaten liver and a gnawed intestine—lying hidden beneath the hems of the robes.

####  Footlocker:
> [!warning] **Encounter**
> Create an encounter similar to ravenloft boneless.
> Folded atop other contents is a **boneless** (Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft, p. 228), made from the flayed skin of Gustav Durst.  
> **Trigger:** Opening the footlocker causes the boneless to attack the nearest creature.  

- **Combat Level:** Bruising
- **Tactics:**  
  - Attacks the nearest creature immediately upon footlocker opening.  
  - Moves across the floor and walls with unnatural flexibility.  
  - Use PF2e stat block from *Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft*.  

- **Items inside the footlocker:**
  - Chain shirt
  - Alchemist's Fire (moderate)
  - Lantern (Bull's-Eye)
  - Thieves' Toolkit (Infiltrator)
  - Healing Potion (Lesser) x4
  - [Bracelet of Dashing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=3060)

## 35. RELIQUARY
When the players enter this room, read:

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The dusty stone steps descend past a landing and around a bend until they end at a cold, rectangular chamber. A thin, wafting mist clings to the ground, and the wooden cross beams that support the ceiling groan beneath the weight of the house and underground complex above.
>
> The walls of this room are cut with small, chiseled alcoves, each holding a strange, ghastly trinket or relic. A corridor with a sagging ceiling exits the chamber and bends out of sight to the right. Past it, you can see a stone slope that descends into black, murky water. The ghostly chant you've heard since entering the basement is strongest here, and seems to be emanating from the other side of a rusted, closed portcullis.
>
> You can finally understand the words. They say, over and over again, in a ceaseless refrain:
>
> "He is the Ancient."
>
> "He is the Land."

### Relics in the Alcoves
The cult amassed several strange "relics" that it used in rituals. These items are mostly nonmagical curios but can be used for roleplay, occult checks, or improvised uses. Each item occupies a niche along the walls:

- **Mummified goblin hand**: yellowed, sharp claws, on a loop of rope  
- **Bone knife**: carved from human bone  
- **Rat skull dagger**: a small dagger with a rat’s skull set into the pommel  
- **Nothic eye orb**: 8-inch varnished orb made from a nothic’s eye  
- **Bone aspergillum**: used for ritual sprinkling  
- **Ghoul-skin cloak**: stitched together from desiccated ghoul hides  
- **Desiccated frog on a stick**: could be mistaken for a wand of polymorph  
- **Bag of bat guano**: dried and crumbling  
- **Hag’s severed finger**: brittle and blackened  
- **Wooden mummy figurine**: 6 inches tall, arms crossed over its chest  
- **Iron devil pendant**: small pendant with a carved devil’s face  
- **Shrunken halfling head**: grotesque and preserved  
- **Coffer with dire wolf tongue**: small wooden coffer holding a dried tongue  

## 36. PRISON
When the players enter this room, read:

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The sound of clinking chains melds with a quiet, near-imperceptible rustling as you round the bend into a long, darkened dungeon. Rusted shackles hang patiently from the walls, as if waiting to bite into prisoners' flesh once more.

### Secret Door
A **secret door** in the south wall leads to Area 38.  
- **Perception Check:** DC 15 Perception to find the door.  
- **Interaction:** Pulling it open reveals the corridor beyond.  

### Treasure
A human skeleton hangs from the back wall of the cell marked X on the map.  
- The skeleton wears a tattered black robe.  Searching the skeleton results in a gold ring worth 25 gp is found on one of its bony fingers.  

## 37–38. PORTCULLIS AND RITUAL CHAMBER
### Portcullis
When the players approach this area, read:

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The floor is submerged beneath two feet of dark, murky water that sloshes around your calves and boots. The tunnel forward is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis. Beyond its iron bars, you can make out the dark outline of a half-submerged chamber, a raised stone dais, and a thick cloud of rolling mist.

- **Mechanism:** The wooden wheel that opens the portcullis remains on the western side of the gate (Outside the Ritual Chamber).  
- **Interaction:** The chain-link mechanism is broken; players must repair it (e.g., with Rose’s mending cantrip) or lift the portcullis by hand. If lifted and released, the portcullis shuts unless propped open.  
- **Strength Check:** Lifting manually requires a DC 20 Athletics (Strength) check.

### Ritual Chamber
 When the players enter this room, read:

> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> The smooth masonry walls of this forty-foot-square room provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood. A small, white bundle lies atop it, surrounded by pulsating, fleshy tendrils.
> As soon as you step foot into the chamber, the ghostly chanting you've heard suddenly falls silent.

The water is 2ft deep and should be treated as difficult terrain for Medium creatures or smaller. Climbing from the pool to the ledges also counts as difficult terrain.

- **Tendrils:** Run to a breach in the far wall, connecting to a dark, hulking shadow within—a flesh mound containing Walter’s spirit and remains. It appears to be sleeping.  

#### Interacting with the Altar
- Approaching the altar reveals the words **"FEED HIM"** carved into its flat surface, surrounded by tendrils inset with human teeth.  
- The bundle atop the altar is infant-sized; unwrapping it reveals a rusted, old blood-stained dagger.  
- **Choices for players:**  
  1. Sacrifice a living creature on the altar. The flesh mound accepts the corpse, devours it, and returns its tendrils. Feeding the mound does **not** free the players.  
  2. Attack the flesh mound. Upon awakening, its screeching wail causes tremors that can damage or collapse the portcullis mechanism.

#### Flesh Mound Mechanics
- **First Form:** Use Bogwid Statblock
- **Engulfed Creature:** Can hear faint baby cries at the center of the mound.  

#### Elisabeth's Amber Shard
- Players holding Elisabeth’s amber shard from the Master Suite can, within 30 feet of the mound, speak "Walter" and issue a brief command.  
- **Check:** DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation).  
- **Effect:** The mound immediately uses a reaction, if available, to follow the command up to its speed.  
- **Limitations:** The mound will not obey commands that are directly harmful and stops following at the start of its next turn.

# Escape from Death House
This scenario takes place after the flesh mound in the Ritual Chamber has been defeated. Players must escape the crumbling house while dealing with environmental hazards, obstacles, and spectral adversaries. Treat this as a dynamic **hazard and skill challenge scenario** rather than traditional combat.

## Scene Setup
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
>  A guttural moan ripples through the air—and a terrifying apparition manifests: Elisabeth Durst’s spirit. her once-beautiful features now grotesquely distorted. 
>  Her sunken eyes blazing with malice and mouth twisted into a snarl. "I will tear this house apart before I let you escape." It throws its head back and lets loose a blood-curdling scream that reverberates across the stone walls—and sets the very foundations of the house trembling.
>  Elisabeth's spirit fixes you with a feral grin—and then dissipates into thin air, leaving only echoes of its spiteful laughter as the house rumbles, shifts, and groans.

**Objective:** Escape from the Ritual Chamber to the Entrance of Death House while navigating hazards and optional encounters.  

**Movement:** The house is difficult terrain in areas affected by falling debris, unstable floors, and collapsing beams. Reduce movement by 5 feet per round in these areas.  

**Hazards:** At the end of each round, each player must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity saving throw** or take 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.

## Reliquary (35) Gustav’s Ghost Encounter
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> An ethereal apparition appears before you, obstructing the stairs—the ghost of a man. He is a gaunt and pale figure, with sunken, haunted eyes and trembling hands, wearing once-fine clothing now tattered with age.
>
> "Please," the spirit says, tears beading at the corners of his eyes. "You have to stay here and die. She won't accept anything else."

- **Statistics:** Use **Poltergeist** from PF2e Core Rulebook, remove invisibility feature.  
- **Social Options:**  
  - **Persuasion DC 10:** Players reference Gustav’s history or show empathy/kindness (automatic success if using Rose or Thorn’s spirits).  
  - **Intimidation DC 20:** Players can threaten or coerce him to move aside.  
- **Combat Options:**  
  - Gustav animates levitating debris (3d6 bludgeoning damage, Reflex DC 15 for half) if ignored or attacked.  
  - He avoids direct melee when possible.

**Outcome:** Successfully persuading Gustav allows the players to proceed. Failing or attacking him triggers environmental hazards.

## Family Crypts (23) Cult’s Return: Environmental Hazard
> [!info] **Read Aloud**
> Thirteen black-robed apparitions appear all around you, chanting "He is the Ancient! He is the Land!" They obstruct the way forward and behind, floating above the ground. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch's fire is black and seems to draw light into it.

- **Properties:**  
  - Intangible: cannot be harmed, turned, or dispelled.  
  - Block paths, forcing players to maneuver.  
  - **At the end of each round:** Players between apparitions must make a **DC 10 Dexterity saving throw** or take 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.  

**Tip:** Players can use **Acrobatics, magic, or creative movement** to bypass the apparitions safely.

## Environmental Hazards Table
| Hazard | Skill / Save | DC | Effect |
|--------|-------------|----|-------|
| Collapsing floorboards | Acrobatics or Athletics | 15 | Prone + 1d6 damage |
| Falling debris | Reflex | 10 | 2 (1d4) damage |
| Unstable ceiling beams | Perception | 15 | Acrobatics DC 15 to avoid falling debris |
| Choking dust / smoke | Fortitude | 12 | 1d4 damage + movement -5 ft next round |
| Narrow escape paths | Acrobatics | 15 | Avoid being slowed or blocked |

**Note:** Players must succeed on appropriate checks to continue at full speed through these hazards.

## GM Tips
- Use skill challenges instead of extended combat rounds to simulate frantic escape.  
- Encourage **creative spell and item use** (e.g., teleportation, levitation, fly, water walk).  
- Track hazards in rounds; resolve damage and movement reductions at the end of each round.  
- Keep tension high with **flavorful read-aloud descriptions** of falling debris, creaking beams, and crumbling walls.
