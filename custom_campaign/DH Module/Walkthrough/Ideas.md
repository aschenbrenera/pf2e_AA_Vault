# Alternative Starting Intros

- Firstly, I would recommend arranging some quick, feasible intro to tell your players as to how they’re all together and in the woods somewhere in the first place. In the world of d&d, this is far easier than you’d think.
    
    - My characters, for instance, were traveling with a merchant caravan. Two were on the run and one was on the general hunt for knowledge and they all ended up in the same group by coincidence. I told them this as exposition. As the caravan settled in for the evening, groups of people split off around a few different campfires and the characters all grouped around one fire in particular. I used this opportunity for them to go around the circle and describe their characters’ appearance as well as have a little role-play where they awkwardly introduced themselves. I made sure to keep this short and let my players’ characters’ all have their time.
        
    - The next morning, they wake up and the caravan is gone. Not only that, but the forest around them is not the same forest that was there the previous night. And a thick fog surrounds them. Ta da! My players were in Barovia.
        
- When your characters are officially in the Svalich Woods, there are a few things you should describe to emphasize the atmosphere.
    
    - This is not the same forest they came from.
        
    - It’s very quiet. The normal, lively sounds of the woods are noticeably absent. Not only that, but the thick fog seems to carry every sound they make much farther than usual, making them all feel loud and exposed.
        
    - Even though it’s morning, the light is dimmer than usual. The mist gives the whole world around them a hazy feel, illuminated by the sterile, white light of a sun far beyond their reach.
        
- THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO TAKE AWAY THEIR STUFF
    
    - Remember, the more desperate the situation, the more the horror shines through. When your characters wake in the morning, tell them that not only are their bedrolls gone, but the actual campfire itself is missing. They should be able to figure that this isn’t the work of some thieves with that information.
        
    - Also, the armor that they doffed before bed is gone. They’re traveling backpacks are gone. Their lanterns are gone. Their weapons are gone. All your characters should have on them at this point are their clothes and a few choice items they wouldn’t take off. For instance, the super paranoid rogue character probably sleeps with a dagger in his pocket. Would one particular character sleep with their coin pouch on? Maybe. Or maybe they would have put it in their backpack which is now gone? Would everyone have taken off his or her shoes before bed? Little details like this will seriously stress your players out and make them feel that much more vulnerable.
        
    - Don’t worry too much about this though. Death House has a good deal items and weapons to help make up for the loss. The point is to make them anxious enough to scavenge. This will also bring out their resourceful side.
        
- At this point, your characters can probably have a nice little role-play experience, panicking together. They’ll eventually come to the conclusion that they can’t stay where they are and start walking in some direction. The heavy mist prevents them from knowing North from South, but it really doesn’t matter which way they walk. Eventually they’ll come across an old dirt road that will lead them in the right direction, towards the Village of Barovia.

### Outside the house
A player who opens any outside-facing door or curtain in Death House, or who exits onto any balcony, finds that the exterior of the house has been surrounded by thick, fleshy tendrils. Although the tendrils can be damaged, more grow back swiftly to replace them, sealing the players inside. A player who inspects the tendrils finds that they appear to be extruding from beneath the house.


### **Time in Death House**
When the clock strikes six, place three six-sided dice on the table in front of the players, with each side showing a six. Each pip on the dice represents twenty minutes until midnight.

As the players explore the house, tick this dice clock downward to indicate the passage of time, always starting with the die showing the lowest number. If the lowest die shows a one, you can tick it down to “zero” by removing it from the group instead.

The dice clock counts down as follows to represent the total time the players have spent in the house:

- Each time the players enter a new floor of the house or dungeon, tick the dice clock down by one.
- Each time the players make a Perception or Investigation check to search an entire room, tick the dice clock down by one.

A full hour passes each time a die decreases from 4 to 3, or each time a die decreases from 1 to 0. The grandfather clock in the **Main Hall** sounds on the hour, every hour, and can be heard throughout the house and dungeon.

When the clock strikes midnight, the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** awakens and makes a beeline for the players, exiting through the **Hidden Trapdoor** into the **Den of Wolves** if necessary to reach them. At least one minute should pass between the time the mound wakes up and the time that it first reaches the players, nullifying its _heavy sleeper_ feature and allowing it to use its _multiattack_ actions.
